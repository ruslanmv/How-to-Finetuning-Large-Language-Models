Your levels are normal with less medications which are very good. As it is genetically induced, it is very difficult to lose weight. My advice to you is, you should focus on maintaining normal levels of TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and try to remain active, having a positive outlook in life. Or else, it will become very difficult to balance your life with the symptoms of hypothyroidism. Even though your weight has not reduced, be very careful in not putting on weight here afterward. Everyday brisk walking for 1 hour. If you have body pain, alternate with exercises and walking. Avoid all kinds of junk foods, processed, bakery products, rich sweets, fatty foods, sodas, alcohol, and smoking. Avoid partying and binge eating. Follow the food timings properly. Have small frequent meals. In between snacks should be strictly fruits or any kind of low-calorie foods. Have unsalted nuts around five daily. It can give a glow to your dry skin. Everyday water intake should be around 1.5-2 liters. You can use flax seeds. Powder it and mix it in your food. It is a fiber which will give you fullness.

{"question": "### Question:\nI get fever during rainy and winter season. Why?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I need to know a few things, 1. Do you feel feverish, or does the thermometer record a temperature? 2. What other symptoms do you get? Runny or blocked nose, sore throat, throat pain with swallowing, headaches, body pains, etc. 3. Does anyone else around you (family members, co-workers, etc.) develop similar symptoms before or after you do? 4. Do you get any tests done like blood tests or X-rays during those episodes? From your description, it appears that you are getting frequent viral upper respiratory tract infections. These are acquired from other patients through the air (coughing, sneezing, etc.). They are usually short-lived and last no more than five to seven days. Since more than 300 different viruses can cause similar symptoms, you can get infected multiple times each time with a different virus. The same virus cannot affect you again. Unfortunately, antibiotics do not work against viruses. They are meant for bacterial infections only. However, doctors continue to prescribe antibiotics unnecessarily, and this has led to the emergence of widespread bacterial resistance. Other than symptomatic treatment, no medicine can cure or prevent these infections. They are self-limited, and you will get better even if you do not take any medication. The older you get, the less frequently you will get these infections as your body will be building up defenses with every disease. No household tips or vitamin supplements have been proven to work. Premature birth can lead to increased frequency of infections, but unless the infections are bacterial, not much can be done about them. Please get back to me with answers to the above questions and also attach any test reports you may have."}

{"question": "### Question:\nAs I am having a history of miscarriages, will taking hCG injections help me to continue pregnancy?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Unfortunately what your doctor has said is right. Spotting in early pregnancy is normal. But a fall or no rise beta HCG is a poor sign. Beta hCG is a hormone produced from fetal tissue. At a level of 25 mIU/mL urine test is positive it doubles in 48 hours. So if the result of 7th is 125, then on 9th it should have been around 250 or more. Only healthy fetal tissue can produce an adequate amount of this hormone, so indirectly we get to know the health of the embryo even without seeing it. So it just means the fetal tissue is not growing. There can be lab errors, so to be on a safer side doctor has asked you to come for scan, to confirm. If you are worried about the repeated miscarriages, have yourself and your partner checked for any problem. Causes like blood sugar levels, thyroid hormone problems, or prolactin hormone abnormalities, any structural problems in the uterus or any problem in semen. Do not lose hope, if you are getting pregnant without much help, no matter what the outcome is, then you will surely have babies.

Avoid watching any material that relates to incest. I am not saying that you should stop masturbating but stop thinking about incest. You are having guilty after incest ideas, so most likely these are intrusive ideas and should be treated also. If possible visit a psychiatrist for help. Medicines like Paroxetine or Fluoxetine can help to control your intrusive ideas and you will feel better. These are safe medicines. Spend your time in outdoor activities.

{"question": "### Question:\nCan Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

{"question": "### Question:\nMy period has been late by 13 days. What could be the reason?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. The striking point in your history is that you have taken morning after pill thrice in the last 4 months. It has to be understood that the most common side effect of an emergency contraceptive pill is delaying the next 2-3 menstrual cycles. As your pregnancy test is negative even after 13 days post period, it clearly indicates that you are not pregnant . Hence, the delay in periods is likely to be due to ipill side effect. Or another possible reason for the delay could be stress induced hormonal imbalance during this menstrual cycle. Stress including emotional, psychological, physical or social disturbances, all have a bearing on the reproductive hormones and can easily delay your menses, once pregnancy is ruled out. It is suggested that you can wait for another week to allow your menses to resume naturally , if not then you may opt for a withdrawal bleed with progesterone pills to resume your menses. As pregnancy test is negative, you can rest assured and wait for another week safely. For further queries, consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"}

{"question": "### Question:\nWhat is the treatment for inguinal lymphadenopathy?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. I assure you not to worry as all things may get settled with proper care and follow-up. 1. Inguinal lymph nodes usually get prominent due to some infection (that you say have been ruled out) or some primary pathology of the nodes themselves. 2. The knots you are talking about also warrants to rule out if that is a vein pathology or lymph nodes can be benign or cancerous changes. Biopsy of the nodes is mandatory especially when there we see changes on ultrasound. 3. Weakness can be due to hemoglobin or red blood cell deficiency. Other causes of weakness may be hypothyroidism or fluid and electrolyte imbalances. 4. Your low sedimentation rate may be due to red blood cell, white blood cell changes and protein abnormality. Sickle cell disease also may cause it. But clinical correlation is the key and for that your physician needs to go for physical examination and if suspicion arises, he may refer you to hematologist. 5. Pain in the lymphatic region can be due to lymph nodes being pressed on or it is possibly from lipomatous changes. 6. I also prefer you to get a detailed heart evaluation from cardiologist as weakness, shoulder and arm issues warrant that too. This kind of symptoms also needs screening for hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Your physician can help you for that too. 7. If you have got tested the above in past 8 weeks, you may upload the reports here for my review and diagnosis. If more than 8 weeks old, please go for repeat fresh tests. Biopsy and histopathology of the lymph nodes. Can be decided on investigations and diagnosis. Revert back with the investigation reports to an internal medicine physician online.--->"}
{"question": "### Question:\nIs it normal to have cobblestone appearance at the back of throat after tonsillectomy?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. All these are normal after tonsillectomy surgery. I will suggest some steps to relieve some of the symptoms you are facing. Gargles with Benzydamine mouth wash diluted in water few times daily will help soothe the area and relieve pain. You may also take Tylenol for a few days for the pain relief. To relieve inflammation (the engorged blood vessels and cobblestone formation) you can take a combination of Trypsin Chymotrypsin Bromelain Rutopside. This medicine will relieve inflammatory cells and products from the area. Cobblestone formation is normal after the surgery. Regarding the reduced length of the uvula and the scarring on the palate, I would say, they are due to bad surgical technique. We carefully dissect the tonsil out of the pillars so that there is nil scarring of pillars and change to the uvula. We use a coblator for the purpose that minimizes bleeding and postoperative pain."}

{"question": "### Question:\nI had unprotected sex during my infertile days. Can I be pregnant?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. Please wait for a week for your period to start. If it does not start by then, you will have to do urine pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy. Period could have been delayed due to stress. Another rare possibility is that of pregnancy. Though you mentioned the days you had sex as your infertile days, sometimes occasionally ovulation could be delayed making the days fertile. Still you had taken emergency pill (though it is highly effective in preventing pregnancy, protection offered is not absolute). So, there can be little chance of pregnancy which you need to rule out first. If you want to rule out pregnancy earlier, you can do blood beta-hCG test, negative result of which will rule out pregnancy. Other option as I told is to wait for a week. If pregnancy test comes negative and still period does not start, you can induce period by taking tablet Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg twice daily for five days. Period generally starts within a week of last dose of tablet. It will not induce period if you are pregnant."}

{"question": "### Question:\nI am 13 weeks pregnant. Kindly explain about subseptate uterus.\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Let me start with a few basic facts and further clinical correlates and effects. Every lady has two uterine tubes, which fuse at birth, and over time, the wall between the two tubes disappear. Now the uterus is converted into a single cavity uterus. The upper ends of tubes remain separate as two fallopian tubes. Sometimes the fusion is complete, but the partition does not disappear. If the tubes do not touch others or do not fuse at all, then you get bicornuate uterus. But if only the wall is partially removed, it forms subseptate uterus. If the wall does not disappear at all, then the septate uterus is formed. Now in both the last two conditions, the main problem is that the space inside the uterus is compromised. The best option was to have a hysteroscopic resection of septa then get pregnant. Having rest makes no difference. At 14 to 16 the week, she can undergo an elective cervical cerclage. Due to septa, uterus loses its polarity, and she is prone to cervical insufficiency. As space inside the uterus is compromised, she can have preterm pains, preterm labor. Due to septate, the baby presentation may not be head down. I hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more questions."}

If BP reading is regular, try to reduce and gradually stop the medicine. Reports of infertility workup are missingHave your periods day three or fourth FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and AMH (antimullerian hormone), to find what is your ovarian reserve.

{"question": "### Question:\nI had spotting on the next day of my unprotected sex. Is this a sign of pregnancy?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Ideally, the emergency contraceptive pill is to be taken within 72 hours of last intercourse to be effective 99 %. It is of no importance if taken after a week. Nevertheless, the bleeding which you got mid cycle before you took the pill was likely to be an ovulation bleed as you had sex in your safe period, then you took the high dose progesterone emergency pill, which initiated a progesterone withdrawal after two days in the form of bleeding as expected. This rules out pregnancy as you had a withdrawal bleed, but it is always best in such cases to get a serum beta hCG test done to be conclusively sure."}

{"question": "### Question:\nWhat are the ways to stop sugar addiction?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Sugar is not an illicit drug, but the brain acts in a similar manner to other substance abuse and addictions. Another reason you could be craving sugar regularly is due to how it makes you feel after consuming it. Generally, a sugary treat causes a rush of both glucose and endorphins in your blood. One of the best things you can do to fight your sugar addiction is to start by swapping sweet foods for healthy alternatives like vegetables. Yes, vegetables can be sweet, but the natural sugars you find in carrots, beets, sweet potatoes, and peas are so much lower than what you will find in treats such as gummies, cookies, or donuts. At the same time, they’ will satisfy your craving for sweetness and you can train yourself to eat these healthier choices over-addictive sugary desserts. The last small tip for fighting your sugar addiction is to generate a plan for how you will eat. You can write this plan out, post it somewhere, or simply keep a mental note of it, but a plan can help you to succeed in various situations. For example, keep carrot sticks cut up in your fridge so that after work, you can plan to snack on those instead of cookies. Or if you are going out to brunch, decide that your plan is to order an omelet with vegetables so that pancakes (basically, a maple syrup delivery device) is not an option. The idea here is to have a plan for how you will succeed in various scenarios that typically create problems for you."}

As you know skull is made up of 16 small bones, these bones are attached with cartilages and get ossified with times. Due to some gaping, this swelling is seen. Give your kid Calcirol sachet once a week for five weeks, dissolve in two spoon water. Syrup Ostebon (Calcium) one teaspoon full twice a day. Feris drops 1 ml once a day.

{"question": "### Question:\nIs it possible to have infertility due to low progesterone levels?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. The reports are fairly normal including the hormonal profile but the progesterone levels (attachment removed to protect patient identity). If these levels are from the proliferative phase then they can be considered normal, however, if from the luteal phase, then they are definitely low. Considering that LH was 11, this test may have been done around day 10 to 14 of your cycle, was it? In cases of progesterone deficiency, one tends to get anovulatory cycles and also shortened cycles with mid cycle bleeds and irregular shedding with often passage of clots, so if not so and if you are experiencing delayed irregular cycles then cause is likely PCOS and not progesterone per se. Also, important in any fertility evaluation is the the male fertility factor. It is important to learn if the semen analysis report of your partner is normal or not, whether the quality and quantity of his sperms are good or not, so please share his semen analysis report as well for review."}
{"question": "### Question:\nMy intraocular pressure is getting high in the last six years. Why?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello.

However, this eye disease is never diagnosed or established based on eye pressure measurements and requires a detailed and comprehensive examination including many diagnostic tests like, visual fields, gonioscopy, OCT (optical coherence tomography), multiple measurements of eye pressure during at least three consecutive days and these tests might be repeated twice and even thrice in the first year and then every six months if the only suspicion remains.

{"question": "### Question:\nWhich one should I opt for a vision problem, a laser treatment or specs?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. This is quite a common question youngsters ask. The best answer to this is it depends on you and your daily activities, profession, and lifestyle, etc. For example, if you want to take up professional sports, modeling, enjoy adventure sports, few jobs in the armed forces, getting a surgery done would be quite necessary. On the other hand, if you want to pursue higher studies and professions where you work a lot with computers and work on fine parts like watchmaking, then surgery would put you at a slight disadvantage as it slightly reduces image quality and increases chances of getting dry eye diseases. Some surgeons also prefer wearing glasses as it protects against infection and blood spurts during operations. With the latest equipment and techniques, laser refractive surgery is quite safe, and outcomes are good. The risk involved is very less. Although a power of - 5.0 is on the higher side, we can still expect good results given that your corneas are suitable for the surgery. The main thing to consider is of course long term outcomes are, 1. As a woman, your power will naturally change during pregnancy and lactation, and this happens to all women. Some have more, others less. This is unpredictable. 2. Surgery only corrects you for distance vision. Another natural change in eyes is presbyopia. Here you need to wear reading glasses. So even if you were to get surgery now, you would only remain glasses free for up to around 40 years of age after which you need reading glasses. I hope this answers your doubts. In case you have any further questions please let me know."}

{"question": "### Question:\nIs Bimatoprost safe enough for optical nerve damage?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I understand your concerns, and I am very sorry to hear about your mother's eye changes. I am afraid that the changes in the optic nerve are indeed irreversible and according to the reports is near total. This is known by the part of the reports that say CDR 0.9 in both eyes. To explain it in a very simple manner, the eye is like a camera, both have lenses, and just like the camera has a film, the eye has the retina. If there is a problem in both the lens and the film, simply changing the lens would not improve the quality of the picture as the film (retina) is also compromised. But in few cases may improve to a limited, yet unknown extent. The problem also gets compounded with her poor general condition with heart problems along with the recent sepsis. So operating on her cataract is quite risky. Regarding the eye drops, Brimonidine eye drops have been known to help in neuroprotection and may help in the preservation of whatever optic nerve function is left, theoretically. So this would be the thought process behind this plan of management given to the overall condition. As far as the next step in managing, it depends on the daily activities of your mother and if at all she feels her current vision is not enough for her to carry out the daily routine activities. In case you need more information, please let me know."}
{"question": "### Question:\nOther than Sutent, which medicine can I opt for papillary renal cell carcinoma?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. As per history given above. Your father as metastatic renal cell carcinoma. I would have liked to have few additional markers like his general condition, report of CBC (complete blood count) and LFT (liver function test), RFT (renal function test) to look at his risk score. In metastatic RCC, in first-line settings we have three TKI (Tyrosine kinase inhibitor) that are approved and commonly used. Namely, Sunitinib, Pazopanib, and Cabozantinib. Sunitinib and pazopanib have almost the same progression-free and survival benefit. Cabozantinib has benefit in progression, but final overall survival was the same as sunitinib. Toxicities are bit different for Pazopanib with more chances of hepatitis, weight loss, and diarrhea. If you are not affording for Sunitinib, then I would say Pazopanib would be better as it is cheaper with similar benefits and slightly different toxicities. Cabozantinib is costlier and not yet available. I hope it helps. I would be happy to help you further if you have any more queries or questions regarding toxicities of these drugs. TKI."}
{"question": "### Question:\nHow to hide the gap that will occur due to the wearing of braces?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Braces are placed to align your teeth more esthetically and camouflage the malpositioned teeth. From your question what I have understood is either you have a large gap already, and for that, you do not have to worry, braces will close it, or you are saying that during treatment you are going to have a gap because of the teeth removal. In that case, I want you to know that a few teeth are removed during orthodontic braces treatment to get space for the rest of the teeth to move and align themselves, and ultimately the gap will be closed. So, in both cases, the gap will be minimized or closed. You do not have to worry. Maintain proper oral hygiene, be careful with the brackets, do not break them, follow the advice of the orthodontist and do not miss any follow-ups as these minor steps will help the treatment to finish on time or maybe a little earlier too. Now, if you can elaborate on your question, I can answer more precisely. A picture of the gap will be helpful also."}

I have gone through the query with keen interest and understand your concerns. Before making any opinions I need to inform you that take the things in objective manner and not on emotions I understand there is history of autism in the family and it does not mean your child suffers with autism. In a normal growing child there are many ups and downs and not responding on some occasions is not indicative of serious pathology like autism. We need to take notice that a child plays well with another child, responds to language on most occasions, cheerful, not having any abnormal repetitive stereotyped movements and communicates with the mother. Having said this I feel it will be appropriate to fill a simple questionnaire called Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ). This is a screening instrument for autism and you will know probably with sure that whether there is problem or not. If you still feel there is something abnormal, then you may contact the specialist doctor nearby for a physical evaluation. For further information consult a psychologist counsellor online -->"}

If there is any way to attach images of the X-rays, that would be ideal (though I know the current situation is not ideal). Assuming it is indeed a scoliosis curvature, I can tell you that you will not be able to straighten your spine (anatomically speaking). If it is a lower cross syndrome, your best bet while you are overseas is to work on core stabilization exercises. Bridge exercises, planks, and clams may all be beneficial to the lumbopelvic-hip-complex. All of these exercises can be found online, but essentially we want to strengthen the weak muscles and relax the overactive muscle. Please get the help of internet resources to have a knowledge of lower cross syndrome to get an idea of what muscles may be overactive and underactive. Without examining you myself, or seeing X-rays, this is about all of the information I can provide. When you return to your place, I would recommend continuing treatment with your chiropractor.

The fact that you are getting positive OPKs each cycle indicates that you have an anovulatory cycle or in simple terms that you are ovulating regularly. PCOD (polycystic ovarian syndrome) cannot be diagnosed alone with just small cysts in ovaries, rather one should have around 10 to 12 multiple small subcenterimetric follicles lining the periphery of the ovary during midcycle scan, one should have featyres of clinical hyperandrogenism like acne, hirsutism (excessive facial and body hair), acanthosis and most importantly oligomenorrhoea or irregular menses. Testosterone alone does not justify the diagnosis. However, if o e needs to be sure, then AMH (ante Mullerian hormone) test can be done, which is more than four indicates PCOD. As mentioned that you are on thyroid medications, I believe your TSH levels are less than five. Please share your ultrasound and hormonal profile reports for review. Now, it would also be essential to check for your partner's semen analysis for quality and quantity of sperms. I am not sure if you have any kids before or not as you have not mentioned, but if you do not yet, then semen analysis of your partner would be mandatory, as your reports are relatively normal.

You are on high dose of Paroxetine and are also taking Milnacipran, Clonazepam and if even with these medicines the symptoms are persisting, then there is no harm in adding a low dose antipsychotic drug like Olanzapine. Olanzapine in low dose has great efficacy in depressive symptoms, anxiety disorders and in resistant depression symptoms.

In that case one option is to reduce the dose of the drug to 2.5 mg and give this a try. This should help you without causing unnecessary sedation. But, I am not sure if the drug will help much in anxiety if used in SOS basis. The drug should be used regularly after dinner and Clonazepam dose can be skipped which can be kept for use on SOS basis. You can have a talk with your psychiatrist for this."}

{"question": "### Question:\nWhat is the harm of stopping Veltam plus in a person with BPH?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I would suggest you continue medicines as at present his flow (which is good) and postvoid (which is less, it should be less only) are because of medicines. I think if he stops the medicines then his urinary symptoms may get worse or postvoid may also increase. There is no harm in taking medicines. Veltam plus (Tamsulosin and Dutasteride) may cause postural hypotension. If he is suffering from severe postural hypotension then he can stop Veltam plus. So harms of stopping are: His urinary symptoms may worsen. His postvoid may increase. He may develop UTI (urinary tract infection). Regarding frequency which is every two hours, I think at 74 years it is fine. Just continue as it is. Because apart from prostate there are many age-related changes in the bladder which cause these symptoms and which are inevitable and irreversible. Until and unless very bad frequency like every half an hour then only intervene. Make some lifestyle changes like drink less water at night before bed. Avoid or reduce drinks which cause diuresis like coffee and tea. For more information consult a urologist online -->"}

{"question": "### Question:\nIf my periods are delayed due to pregnancy, can Medroxyprogesterone cause abortion?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. How are you doing? You can definitely take either of the medicines, they both are the same. They are both Medroxyprogesterone acetate, and it is the same hormone which is released from your ovaries in the second half of periods after ovulation. In PCOD (polycystic ovary disease), as you are not ovulating, this hormone will be deficient. So, taking the pill meprate will cause bleeding, only if you are not pregnant. If there is pregnancy, this same progesterone hormone is produced by the ovary to support the fetus. So, these medicines will not cause abortion, but it will support it further. These medicines are very safe whether you are pregnant or not. It can never cause abortion. Hope I have clarified your doubt, do write back. All the best.

{"question": "### Question:\nA white patch has been formed at the tip of the penis associated with skin tightness. Why?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Let me tell you one thing, you need not worry about your condition, as it is widespread to have phimosis, which is the case with you. The foreskin is tight in your case, and hence, retraction is painful. The white patch you are referring to is nothing but color due to fibrosis. This has nothing to do with masturbation. You can undergo a simple procedure called circumcision, which will get rid of the foreskin and your problem with it, once for all. It is a minor procedure. Please address the issue of hygiene better. Though there will not be any serious health issues with cleanliness, absence of hygiene can result in fungal infection, which can be avoided by addressing the hygiene properly. Let me reassure you again, and you need not worry much, go for circumcision."}
{"question": "### Question:\nPlease advice whether I can continue my same dosage of thyroid tablets after the variation of TSH levels.\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. The goal of treatment in hypothyroidism is to normalize TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) levels. The dose of thyroxine needs to be adjusted until this happens. The dose is weight related to some extent. The approximate dose of thyroid hormone is equal to weight in kg x 1.6. But ultimately, it is the TSH that guides the dosage. Here is what you need to do, 1. Increase the dose of Thyroxine to 100 mcg once a day. 2. Take the tablet on an empty stomach. Do not consume anything except water for one hour after taking Thyroxine. (No tea, coffee, milk, iron or calcium tablets, etc.). 3. Whenever the dose of Thyroxine is adjusted, recheck TSH after six to eight weeks. 4. No diet restrictions for hypothyroidism. Contrary to popular belief, it is fine to eat cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, soybeans, etc. I hope this helps."}

{"question": "### Question:\nPlease guide how to use snehapana at home.\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Ideally, you should have done it under the supervision of a nearby Ayurveda physician. Because this procedure also requires a close watch and some dietary restriction. Even if you are taking some medicine without guidance, it is not advisable to do it on your own. It can also cause some issues like nausea, vomiting, etc. in some cases, and it might be hard for you to manage it at home. The amount of ghee should be taken on various factors, and it requires a complete history and clinical examination. Also, the amount of ghee needs to be increased day by day for some days. After intake of ghee symptoms need to be watched for proper digestion. If the physician does not find appropriate digestive symptoms, then he can manage accordingly. After proper digestion of ghee, a particular dietary regimen and lifestyle have to be managed. So you should do it under supervision. I hope you understand my point that rather than doing it at home, it is better to do under the supervision of a nearby Ayurveda physician."}

{"question": "### Question:\nWhat are the abortion options during 6 weeks of pregnancy?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. For someone who is 6 weeks or 42 days pregnant as per the ultrasound and the pregnancy has been localized intrauterine, there are actually two options: In medical abortion the patient is given a set of medicines namely Mifepristone and Misoprostol in a set protocol. The aim is to disallow further growth of pregnancy by stopping the cytotrophoblastic invasion into the endometrium (through Mifepristone) and then initiating uterine contractions and placental separation (through Misoprostol). The procedure for drug protocol lasts till max 2000 mcg of Misoprostol has been given in a set protocol till the pregnancy has been aborted. The success rates are 93%-96%, but the disadvantage is that it may lead to prolong bleeding for up to two weeks before all the products of conception can be actually aborted. Sometimes, the bleeding just continues for long and one may have to resort to surgical curettage to remove the remaining decidua in utero. Surgical evacuation is a day care procedure where a suction canal is introduced inside the uterus through the cervix, with patient under anesthesia or a paracervical block and the products of conception are suctioned out completely. If the procedure is ultrasound guided, then the success rates are 100 percent and major advantage is, one can leave for work after 6 hours (till the anesthesia effect passes of if general anesthesia or after 2 hours in case of post paracervical block). The remote chances of Asherman syndrome or intrauterine adhesions have been documented in 1% of women who underwent surgical evacuation where adhesions were formed inside the uterus leading to secondary infertility. But, a controlled, ultrasound guided dilation and curettage under an experienced hand is safe. I would suggest her to opt for medical abortion if the pregnancy is unplanned or accidental as this would be a natural way of aborting and moreover pregnancy being less than 7 weeks, can be easily aborted. A repeat ultrasound pelvis to check for completion of abortion shall be necessary after the procedure is undertaken. The mild bleeding and discharge may or may not continue for long, it depends from woman to woman. If this fails, then of course you have a surgical option to look at. Pregnancy should be completely avoided for the next four months of post procedure as that is the time required by uterus and pelvic organs to return back to their pre-pregnant state."}

I understand your concern as your grandparents passed of a heart attack, the fear you have is genuine. But, just pain in your chest is not an indication of a heart attack. Since you gave a history of carbonated food and tablet Amoxicillin along with thyroid medication, these both can cause an acid reflux and that can cause heartburn and lead to such non-specific pain. However, if the pain was associated with sweating and stabbing character or constricting type with radiation to the left arm, then it is always better to get an ECG done to see if it is related to your heart.

{"question": "### Question:\nWhat is the small fleshy growth in my anus?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. I have seen your attached picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It shows old hemorrhoids called as skin tags. This picture, along with the pain that you are describing is suggestive of anal fissure. This is a tear in the wall of the anus, at the base of these skin tags. Here is what you need to do: To heal the fissure, do sitz bath. Take lukewarm water in a medium sized tub, put two teaspoons of ordinary salt per liter of water. Total 10 g salt per liter of water. Now sit in this water and try to push out on the anus. Try to make the water clean and sooth your anal region. Sit for around 15 minutes, 3 to 4 times every day for a month or so. Try to do this at least twice per day if you are working professional. It will decrease pain, itching, and help to heal the fissure. Do these for around 6 to 8 weeks. For pain relief during passing stools as well as healing of the fissure, I suggest the following or equivalent generic combinations for at least three weeks, after that only sitz bath should be enough: For constipation, I suggest you try the following: Curing constipation treats these and also prevents these from troubling again. Some people need surgical treatment for bleeding hemorrhoids, but only if dietary measures are not effective in controlling the problem. I hope that helps. Kindly leave feedback.

{"question": "### Question:\nCan long-time earphone usage cause pain in ears?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. My understanding and inference is that the pain is not related to the earphones or sound level. This is because of loud noise which usually produces classical symptoms like giddiness, ringing sound in ear, hearing loss, intolerance to loud sounds and some pain in ear. Your symptoms are not very classical to diagnose. Please answer below questions for clear diagnosis. With the details available as of now, I infer that the pain is muscular most probably. For the same, I suggest you the following measures. To understand any occurrence of sound trauma to your ears we must do a pure tone audiometry. This is the definitive investigation to understand any damage to inner ear due to sound. I feel a strong pain killer like Aspirin is not required for these complaints. However, there is no reason to worry as of now. Muscle ache. Bad posture. Rigorous exercise. Pure tone audiometry (this investigation is usually present in speech centers and otolaryngology clinics).

{"question": "### Question:\nI am getting pain in penis and tingling sensation in testicles. Please help.\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. Your symptoms do point towards chronic prostatitis. With negative culture and positive pus cells, it is likely that you are suffering from CPPS IIIA, which is non-bacterial inflammatory chronic prostatitis. Now, this is a difficult condition to manage and requires long-term therapy. I would suggest that you follow up with a urologist on a long term basis. Therapy takes some time and different medications work for different patients. IC (interstitial cystitis- painful bladder) is also a possible condition, but CPPS is more common in males than IC. You do not meet all criteria for IC as per the classic definitions. So, I would keep CPPS as the first differential. I am mentioning some tests that you may want to get done to clarify the situation in a better way. Recurrent infections. Urine anti-proliferative factor, EPS Culture (expressed prostatic secretions) after prostatic massage, uroflowmetry with post-void residual urine assessment and cystoscopy. 1. CPPS IIIA. 2. BPS (bladder pain syndrome) / IC. I suggest combination of Amitriptyline, alpha blockers, NSAIDS (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and Gabapentin. Dietary modifications will be necessary.

{"question": "### Question:\nWhich ayurvedic medicine can give a long time relief from asthma?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Regarding the continuation of medicines, you may have to use the multivitamin tablet, Septilin (Tinospora) and Bresol (Turmeric, Vasaka, and Vaividang) for a long time till your allergic condition persists. These medicines are for helping your body develop good immunity against the respiratory problems. These medicines act slightly different than inhalers. Although, I would like to tell you that inhalers are scientific. Ayurvedic medicines may not help to get respite from an acute problem. Asthma is a manifestation of hypersensitivity. It is wise to find the cause of the hypersensitivity. We call the same allergy. Rhinitis asthma is different manifestations of allergy. Allergy is present in the genes, and we may not be able to cure allergy entirely. Allergen avoidance forms the mainstay of the treatment and management of allergy. You should be carefully noting down which areas and circumstances lead to the symptoms in you. Like going to gardens, smoking, pollution, dust, particular smells and fragrances, fumes, effluents, climate, etc. You should also note when the symptoms are more and when they are less. Whether there are any seasonal or diurnal variations. Once you have a detailed diary regarding this, you will be able to make some reasonable conclusions regarding when you have to be careful. Next method of finding out the allergen is allergy testing. The two methods available are skin prick testing and blood immunoCAP method. Both methods are easy and fast, but skin prick testing is more accurate. Once we find out the allergens causing the problem for you, we can give you specific advice on how to avoid these allergens and stay safe. The treatment of Septilin and Bresol that you are taking are to help your body stay healthy, improve immunity, provide all nutrients and micronutrient for the body to deal with offending agents. But these are not the definitive cure for the problem. Hence, it is not possible to say clearly till what time you will have to take the medicines. Additionally, if you get an asthma attack during the course of these medicines, you may still need inhalers or nebulization or medicines on an SOS basis. Do share with us your prescriptions and investigations reports so that we can help you better. Hope to see you healthy soon. For more information consult an allergy specialist online -->"}

{"question": "### Question:\nWhat treatment will help for discolored skin and red circles in inner thigh?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. At the onset I would like to tell you that though I understand your concern and situation, but there is nothing to be ashamed or apprehensive of yourself. It is a medical problem and can only be tackled by proper medical treatment and advice, and not by hiding your problem from doctors. It is great that you do not smoke as it may increase your problem. According to your weight and height your BMI is 35, which falls in borderline to moderately to severely obese. I advise you to visit or ask an endocrinologist regarding the shrinking of the testicles and erectile issues as these may be related to hormonal balance or even obesity. Red circles on the inner thighs (attachment removed to protect patient identity) are indicative of fungal infection known as tinea cruris. For this, a course of antifungals is advised. I would suggest the following treatment. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. The outgrowths of skin are skin tags and they are usually related to hyperlipidemia. They are not harmful and only have cosmetic concerns. They are best dealt with by simple office based surgery with cautery machine requiring only local anesthesia, which is a 5 minute superficial procedure. But, they will not go on their own. You may get your fasting serum lipid profile done, which will measure the levels of cholesterol, LDL (low-density lipoprotein), VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) and HDL (high-density lipoprotein). If any of these are abnormal suitable, then medicine can be started. Medicine is important as abnormal lipid profile increases one's risk of cardiac events in the future. One important thing on which I cannot emphasize enough would be decreasing your weight. If you can gradually decrease your weight even by a few pounds, you would see a lot of these medical problems would get better by themselves. You may follow up after two to three weeks.

{"question": "### Question:\nCan I use Kojivit gel to get fair skin?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent.

They may relieve your symptoms in the short run but may harm your eyes if used for long term. Pain in the corner should not affect your eyesight. Just use appropriate glasses.

Glaucoma is a chronic disease that tends to progress regardless of all actions taken by the ophthalmologist slowly. Our main approach towards glaucoma is to keep it under control because we are not able to treat it and based on your history of ophthalmic care you seem to be in good hands, but you should be very punctual on your follow-up and doctor's recommendations.

{"question": "### Question:\nCan minimally invasive glaucoma surgery be done in sensitive eyes with glaucoma?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I am very sorry to hear about your mother's eyes. I suspect that she must have undergone the retina laser and the injections for a condition called as diabetic retinopathy. I feel that most likely it is a complication of diabetic retinopathy that might have caused a high pressure in her eyes. Xen gel stent is currently FDA approved for refractory glaucoma not caused by diabetic neovascularization and Inn focus micro shunt is currently being tested for long term side effects and usefulness in such situations. I must be clear in letting you know that neovascular glaucoma is a very adamant disease to treat and the treatment may not be straightforward and may require multiple procedures and reviews with the treating doctor, yet the most often agreed upon surgery, across most hospitals in the world is currently Ahmed glaucoma valve, along with of course the laser and injections.

As you said correctly that asthma patients should always take care of their diets as some food ingredients may cause a severe asthma attack. Grossly we cannot avoid all food types because there is person to person variability to the food allergy. So you should strictly avoid food that is causing some difficulty in breathing or attack. To find out exactly we can do skin prick allergy test or blood allergy test so that you definitely know what food you are allergic to. After that, you must avoid those food items. Processed foods, some bakery items containing eggs, chilled drinks, food colorants, should be strictly avoided. Always check ready-made foods or processed foods for ingredients. Sometimes butter, cheese, yogurt, and milk also needs to be avoided in some cases of diagnosed allergy. Otherwise, you can enjoy fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet."}

Just check the medication freeflex might contain MSM. Regarding osteopenia, I advise her to continue calcium and consult local orthopaedic surgeon if he can help her with some medications that can build up calcium.

{"question": "### Question:\nI lost my hearing capacity due to meningitis. Should I consult a rheumatologist?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. The main problem with meningitis is that it is an infection which causes irreversible damage. As far as knowledge goes, there are not many cases who benefitted with the hearing. The cochlea is the hearing organ of the human body. It has three partitions filled with fluid. When hearing loss is caused by meningitis, the cochlea begins to ossify (the canals in cochlea start turning into bone). Thus the sound vibrations are not able to reach the auditory nerve. Usually, the loss is permanent. If you already wear hearing aids and now having a problem with understanding the speech, you need to see an audiologist and recheck your hearing as it might have progressed. If the loss has increased, please reprogram your hearing aids. If it has not changed, then you need to practice communication perception techniques. A speech therapist can help you with the techniques to improve communication. There are few techniques for better communication, but as you have not mentioned, I am not familiar with what method you use. I feel you should have discussed the problem in detail so that I could have helped you more with techniques. Do not hesitate to contact me."}

{"question": "### Question:\nCan skin prick tests predict positive reactions completely?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. Skin prick allergy testing is one of the most accurate ways of diagnosing the allergen, one is sensitive to. It is definitely more accurate than blood immunoCAP testing (blood allergy testing). Skin prick testing checks your sensitivity to the protein in question. Even if sensitive, it need not mean you are allergic. Whereby, a positive result need not always mean you will get allergy with the protein. It means that your immune system is sensitised to that allergen and that an allergy can occur in subsequent exposures to the allergen. A negative in skin prick testing will mean that you are not sensitive to that protein and that you will not end with an allergy upon its exposure. This is true. But it is specific for the particular type of allergen. What all animal danders were included in your profile and what was the response to each? Is there a photograph or record of the wheal or flare that developed after each prick? Was the test read by a clinical allergist or immunologist and were you provided a report as to that you are not allergic to any animal dander? Were you diagnosed with pollen allergy or sensitivity? Have you observed any symptoms of allergy while in gardens or bushy areas? Or in any particular season? Does any one else in your family have allergies?"}

You have put your query with nice description but I think you have uploaded wrong images. So, if possible share correct images. From your description, it seems atopic eczema. It is endogenous eczema which may have several aggravating factors. Predisposition may come from the hereditary mechanism. Other first or second degree relatives may have features of some kind of allergy or atopy. Seasonal changes may also affect disease course. Some food like groundnut, cow milk, an egg may cause the problem. It starts with dry skin. Then some tiny lesions, sometimes oozing, scaling, crusting. They may coalesce to form large plaques. So we have to put first check on dry skin by use of plenty of moisturizers. It is best to use just after taking bath, tap the water with towel softly then apply moisturizer within 3 to 5 minutes of the bath. And have to apply 3 to 4 times a day as per requirement of skin to combat dryness. The dry or cracked skin may produce stinging sensation: burning sensation initially but it will go on its own. Or you can try a different moisturizer, even a good vaseline or coconut is also perfect. Topical steroids are useful during exacerbation of disease. It comes in different potency, and I hope your doctor had prescribed low-mid potency one. Like Hydrocortisone, Desonide, Flucinolone or Fluticasone. Among these, Desonide is best according to efficacy and safety. There is nothing like being habitual. You can stop anytime. But try to stop in tapering way like initially daily, then alternate day then weekends then stop. Your baby is 5 years old so you have one more option to replace steroids. Topical Tacrolimus 0.03 % ointment. Once lesions are clear by use of steroid then you can shift to Tacrolimus. Or on the face, it is alone sufficient. No need to use steroids on the face. How to manage with minimum medicine: Can moisturiser be avoided? No. Apply with a soft hand, do not massage vigorously. When will she get better? Usually, 80 % child become better by age of 12 to 13 years. But it depends on several factors like family history, exposure to aggravating factors, management of exacerbations. You have to pamper skin of your baby, care during cleaning, tapping, applying moisturizer all needed. There are several another way to treat exacerbation so you should not be worried.

{"question": "### Question:\nMy penis size is smaller than normal, will it be a problem during sex?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Thanks for choosing this platform. 2 to 5 inch of the penis size is normal. The average size of penis is 3-5 inch while erect and 1-3 inch while flaccid. Having said this I like to inform you that penis size does not make things different during sex as only one third of the female vagina is sensitive. So, even 3 inch of penis in erect state provides equal pleasure to both partners. In regard to penis size your fear of small penis is baseless and you can get this idea out of your mind now. Girl may or may not think about the size as it is their domain, but as I said it dose not matter on bed. What you read in pornographic magazines is distorted presentation and does not hold any truth. I do not understand what do you mean by small testicle and low sperm count. It is the number of seminiferous tubules in the testis that matters. Other than that if you are having doubt you can get report of semen analysis which will reveal true sperm count in your semen. Having morning time erection is completely normal and there is nothing to worry about that. If you do not get morning erection that may be a sign of problem.

As you are only 17 years old, the primary cause behind it might be genetic as your parents or grand parents may have white hairs at an early stage. The other possible causes might include poor nutrition, improper lifestyle, stress, etc. White hairs mean lack of melanin, the coloring pigment in hairs. Once the hair that grows white, there are fewer chances to revert them back to normal black color. But, you can stop further graying of hairs. First of all add foods like figs, curry leaves, raisins, fresh fruits, and vegetables in your diet. Avoid excessive caffeinated drinks, spicy and junk food. Quit smoking and drinking if you do. Sleep adequately at least for 6 to 8 hours a day. Try to go to bed before midnight. Avoid taking too much stress. As far as medicine is concerned, I suggest tablet Asthiposhak two tablets twice a day with water for six weeks. Apply Bhringraj oil on your hairs two to three times a week one night before washing hairs. Wash your hairs with a mild herbal shampoo. Have one glass of lukewarm milk and add a pinch of black pepper and turmeric in it and take it before sleeping. Try all these things, and you will soon feel positive results. 1. Genetics. 2.

{"question": "### Question:\nCan you explain the reason behind burning sensation of gums?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. Hurting of gums while taking spicy food might be due to the following causes: 1. Gingivitis (swelling and inflammation of the gums) - Swollen gums may be painful and may cause burning sensation and pain while taking hot and spicy food. Gingivitis occurs due to either plaque or other debris accumulating around the teeth and gums. Also hormonal changes occurring during menstrual cycle can cause swollen and painful gums. Any medicines taken for medical issues like hypertension, epilepsy, etc., also cause gum changes and swelling. 2. Any ulcers in the mouth will get hurt while taking hot and spicy food. Ulcers might occur due to faulty tooth brushing techniques, usage of toothbrushes with hard bristles, stress, sharp tooth hurting the tissues, any dental appliances or ill-fitting dentures. 3. Any abscess related to infected tooth might also hurt while taking spicy food. But, you have mentioned that you do not have any cavities or teeth issues. Have you been examined by a dentist regarding this? 4. Any impacted tooth (teeth that remain unerupted due to inadequate space inside the mouth or remain inside the bone itself) may develop swelling of gums around it. When the opposing teeth impinges on this swollen tissue while taking spicy food it gets hurt. 5. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur to certain foods. This might cause swelling, reddening and burning sensation of the mouth. This may occur due to some food additives. 6. Habits like smoking and usage of tobacco products may also cause burning sensation while consuming spicy and hot food. 7. Dental procedures like scaling (cleaning of teeth) might cause minor tissue injuries. These hurt and cause burning sensation while taking hot and spicy food. But, this heals in 4-5 days after cleaning. In your case, this might not be the reason, as you have undergone scaling before 2-3 years. 1. Get dental scaling done, if you have any plaque or calculus deposits causing swollen gums. 2. Get your oral cavity examined by your dentist, for any ulcers, abscesses, infected teeth and impacted teeth. 3. Also get checked for any sharp teeth and any dental appliances or ill-fitting dentures. If found, sharp teeth have to be trimmed and reduced, and ill-fitting dentures and dental appliances have to be corrected immediately. 1. Kindly make a note if you develop any gum swelling, redness or bleeding gums during your periods. 2. Use toothbrushes with soft bristles for brushing your teeth. Also follow the proper brushing technique for brushing your teeth. 3. Make a note whenever your gum hurts and what foods hurt your gums. Check if any food causes the same issue repeatedly. In case, if that food contains some additive that causes hypersensitive reaction, then you may have to avoid that particular food in future. 4.Quit habits like smoking or usage of other tobacco products (in case you do).

You can also try the withdrawal method where you need to withdraw just before ejaculation, but it needs lots of mental strength on your part. Your partner can also use certain female condom or spermicides also. Use emergency contraceptive methods to prevent pregnancy after having an unprotected sex.

{"question": "### Question:\nI have bad faeces smell coming from my nose when I breathe. What could be the possible causes?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Bad smell during breathing could be due to various reasons. Let us see those one by one. Malignancy: an intranasal (inside the nose) or intraoral (inside the mouth) malignancy can produce foul smell, that can be perceived as faeces smell by the nose. Malignancy can be painless and without any symptoms. Malignancies of paranasal air sinuses also produce foul odor. Dental infection: a tooth decay can produce bad smell. Dental infection usually produces significant pain. Food particles get collected inside the decayed tooth and hence cause the bad smell. Sinusitis: Chronic sinusitis can cause constant post nasal drip and purulent discharge (pus discharge). This results in foul odor. Maxillary sinusitis commonly produces foul odor. Sinusitis will have other symptoms like headache, facial pain, nasal blockage, post nasal drip, etc. Foreign body inside nose: A foreign body which has got stuck inside nose without being removed for many days will produce purulent discharge and smell. The discharge will be from one side of the nose. It is common among kids. Foreign body produces nasal block. Atrophic rhinitis: It is a disease where the normal space inside the nose gets increased due to destruction of the anatomy. Also the condition causes merciless anosmia (loss of sensation of smell). The sufferer cannot perceive any smell but the people around him can get the extreme foul odor emanating from the patients nose. Atrophic rhinitis also presents with crusting inside nose and nose block. Maggots in nose: Maggots are larval stage of fly (chrysomia). Maggots usually occur in association with atrophic rhinitis. Fly lays its eggs inside nose leading to maggots inside nose. They are attracted to the foul odor and they themselves aggravate the odor. Tonsillitis: Pus accumulated over the tonsil can cause bad smell. Tonsillar enlargement with infection and consequent foul breath is common in many children. Other symptoms of tonsillitis include fever, throat pain, enlarged lymph nodes of neck, difficulty and pain while swallowing. Nasal diphtheria can produce foul odor. Diphtheria produces a membrane over the affected mucosa. Rhinitis caseosa: it is a destructive disease producing foul odor. It was thought to be a fungal disease, exact etiology is still not clear. Tuberculosis: TB of nasal mucosa produces granulomatous inflammation and caseating necrosis, consequent death of tissues and foul smell. Hope I have cleared your query. Further evaluation and clinical examination is required. For further follow up, consult an ENT otolaryngologist online.--->"}

{"question": "### Question:\nWhy do I have bad smell coming from my nose?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. The first thing that comes to my mind is a disease called atrophic rhinitis.

In this condition, the patient has decreased sense of smell, but others can feel bad smell coming out from the patient's nose. A diagnostic nasal endoscopy is sufficient to diagnose the condition.

Seroquel is Quetiapine, and the drug is an antipsychotic and mood stabilizer drug. In high doses in some individuals the drug is known to result in side effects like reduced libido, sometimes delayed ejaculation, difficulty in orgasm, etc. But Quetiapine is one of the safer antipsychotics if we compare this drug with other antipsychotic drugs.

But the dose you were taking that is 50 mg is not a very high dose. Stopping this would not result in much withdrawal except mild insomnia. If we link this with sexual side effects of Quetiapine or Seroquel, then this will reverse by own in coming days. In most cases, sexual side effects go by own in less than four weeks of stopping the offending drug. You were not on a very high dose so that the recovery would be earlier. Prolactin levels increase seen with antipsychotic use (in high doses for a long duration, but some individuals even in low dosage).

{"question": "### Question:\nMy child developed phobia for terrorist. How to eliminate this?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Child's mind is very delicate and easily moldable. Subtle things can cause drastic and unexpected effect on them, which we cannot even predict at times. In your case, it is quite easily observable to you. It is good that you could recognize this change in her behavior so early and decided to take an opinion for the same without wasting further time. Violence and rage have very severe effect on a child's mind. This is what happened with your daughter. The violence depicted in the movie and the reactions caused by that violence in the movie characters have made a deep impact on her mind. The fear caused by that violence had got imprinted on her mind. This can be the beginning of development of an underlying anxiety illness in her. So, it is very important for you as a parent to help her overcome this. You have to gradually make her aware that though the terrorist are the ones who spread violence and chaos, but on the other hand there are good people also who stop them. To begin with storytelling is a good way to inculcate things. Then play therapy can help. You can get her into play activities where you can strengthen her faith that there is no need to be afraid of bad guys and there are always good guys to help with. Gradually start taking her out and expose her to the people in neighborhood. Tell her about different kind of people living nearby. Familiarize her with the surroundings. Besides this, you should avoid watching content depicting violence and rage in front of your daughter. Child's age is a tender part of their life, they learn very quickly. So, use this as a therapy to manage her fear."}
{"question": "### Question:\nHow can I divert my mind when I become sad due to the rude behavior of my loved one?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. It looks like you and your partner have different personality styles and deal with conflicts differently. For example, if you are an extrovert, you would like to talk your way through issues. But if your partner is an introvert, he may have an aversion to conflict and arguments and may withdraw during stressful periods. This is a natural way of responding to some people and not to be taken personally. If your partner is otherwise fine and treats you well, it may be helpful to have an open and honest discussion with him when both of you are calm. Write down your thoughts if direct talking can be difficult and ask your partner to reply. Both of you have to respect each other and learn to form your ways of dealing with conflict as a couple. It is natural for all couples to have disagreements, try not to overthink in such situations. Try relaxation techniques and carry on with your usual routines. If needed, you can try counseling or couples therapy. Also, look after your emotional health. Consult your doctor to review your mental health and the need for continuing anti-depressants. I hope this helps."}

{"question": "### Question:\nWhat are the ways to control schizophrenia?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I can understand your concern. A lot of patients of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder refuse to take medicines and this becomes difficult in treatment.

You will have to remain alert for this. This should be followed strictly. In coming days he will become ready to take medicines by own. Till then you can give him Risperidone liquid. He is on 2 mg per day and if needed, the dose can be increased to 3 mg per day. The second option in his case if he refuses to take even food or juices from you is long-acting injectables. Long-acting injections of Haloperidol or Fluphenazine or Risperidone or Paliperidone are available. These have actions for around 15 days and can be given to him if he refuses to take medicines. This can make treatment easy for him. You can discuss with his doctor for this treatment option."}

It is important you are at peace and have some relief from the distress. Coming to your symptoms, you have said you have intrusive thoughts but what kind of intrusive thoughts do you have? And apart from saying prayers and touching wood is there anything else that you do? From your history, it does seem that you are having severe OCD which is causing a lot of anxiety. If Prozac has helped you in the past, you can reconsider the same medication but you will have to take it for longer duration like two years or more and at a higher dose like 60 mg. Consider tablet Clomipramine 20 mg along with Prozac for an augmentation effect. For acute anxiety, you can consider tablet Etizolam on SOS basis. As for psychotherapy, rather than CBT, exposure and response prevention seems to be a more helpful option for you but we can explore more on that only when we know the exact nature of your intrusive thoughts.

{"question": "### Question:\nI am consuming Codeine. Will this affect conceiving?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi, Welcome to icliiq.com. I read your query and understand your concerns. First of all I would like to inform you that Codeine can be stopped in gradual manner. Scientifically speaking you can go for 10% reduction of original dose every week leading to complete abstinence at the end of 2-3 months. In case this is not possible or you are not able to tolerate the lower dose of Codeine you can get yourself treated form local psychiatrist. We often recommend Clonidine for this purpose which helps in the withdrawal symptoms of Codeine. The medication dose is decided depending on the dose of Codeine, age of the patient, duration of abuse and blood pressure. I mean to say that this is high time to say \"NO TP ADDICTION\" and take this opportunity to come out of this addiction without delay. I understand that your concern is not addiction but inability of your wife to get pregnant despite repeated efforts. But we need to understand that addiction and infertility are related to some extent and removal of one risk factor might pave for fathering a child. In addition it is also important to get semen analysis done for yourself and follicular study for your wife to rule out other causes."}

{"question": "### Question:\nKindly explain about the diastolic heart failure.\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I am sorry to hear that you did not receive any detailed explanation of your condition. Diastolic dysfunction is the inability of the heart to relax, which can be diagnosed with echocardiogram or with evidence of high pressures inside your heart chambers, as evidenced by the increase LVEDP (Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure) in your cardiac cath (it was 24 mmHg, and normal is considered less than 15 or 18 mmHg). The term diastolic heart failure is used when we have evidence of diastolic dysfunction as above in addition to symptoms of heart failure (the shortness of breath you described). There is some belief that diastolic heart failure is more benign than systolic heart failure, but in reality, that is not the case. They have similar prognosis when compared in general. However, patients with advanced systolic heart failure have a worse prognosis than those with diastolic heart failure. The complicating aspect is that there are no many proven therapies that work for diastolic heart failure, other than low sodium diet, diuretics, exercise, proper eating, and lifestyle modification. To provide a more precise diagnosis, it would be essential to understand how is your exercise tolerance, however that can be challenging with your multiple sclerosis. I hope this information helps. I do not want you to feel discouraged but instead focus on lifestyle modification. Eating well, stress reduction (mindfulness or mediation can help) and practice physical activity. Hypertension, and obesity. Possibly an exercise stress test to objectively assess your exercise capacity, sleep study, and probably a Holter or event monitor (to assess for arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation)."}

What you have heard about lack of Vitamin D as its cause is a myth among patients because nowadays there is a new class of topical drugs available which are analogues of Vitamin D. These reduce the excessive cell proliferation and differentiation seen in the skin cells of a psoriasis patient. A few of these drugs are Calcipotriol, Calcitriol, and Tacalcitol. Their pros are that they do not cause skin atrophy, but they are useful only for stable and moderate psoriasis.

{"question": "### Question:\nSore throat did not go away with several antibiotics. How can I get well again?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I have gone through your complaints. Repeated attacks of a low-grade sore throat suggest that it could be chronic pharyngitis. The other common causes of chronic sore throat are due to acidity and gastroesophageal reflux.

{"question": "### Question:\nI get bloody semen with clots and pain in my right testicle. What is my problem?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Hematospermia (blood in semen), is fairly common. Generally it is not considered as a sinister sign. There are whole list of possibilities for this theoretically, but once we ensure it is not due to sinister cause and rule out treatable causes say like infections we do not beyond that as it will not affect the management. Sinister causes mainly prostate and testicular cancers. At your age prostate cancer is extremely unlikely but need to ensure no testicular problem. With your symptoms with testes, you need another scan to be on safe side as the scope for examination to be conclusive. I suspect you have epidydimal cysts which are very common and can cause pain, etc. So if the scan does not show anything other than this, I would not worry about it at all. I think the rash is completely unrelated to this or any of your urological problems. Nor the rash or hematospermia is related to old history of chlamydia. Since you have not had any other urinary symptom, I would not worry much about other tests related to urinary tract. However, I would also recommend sending semen for culture to see any infection in it. Lastly about prostate cancer virtually unheard in your age. Finger examination of prostate, PSA blood test and MRI scans of prostate are the screening tests in general. But not something I would recommend if testes scan comes back normal and if you are still worried an MRI then will be helpful as last resort. Idiopathic. Testicular pathology. Ultrasound scan of testes. Ideally an examination of genitals including prostate by a clinician. Semen culture. Idiopathic. Hematospermia. With reports."}
{"question": "### Question:\nI am getting pimples and dark spots. How to treat it?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I will help you with your problem. You are having acne vulgaris which is the most common skin condition of your age. Generally, the eruptions on healing leave a mild dark spot. If the eruptions are manipulated by picking them or squeezing them, they leave darker spots on healing. In your case, if you are having oily skin, you should use Ahaglow S facewash four to five times a day. This will prevent oily skin which is one of the main causes of the acne. For the treatment of the eruptions, you should use Deriva CMS gel on the eruptions at night daily. Also take tablet Azithromycin 500 mg three days a week for 1 month (3 days daily dose, then 4 days gap, then repeat). The dark spots, if persist after the course of treatment, can be treated by other creams then. Acne vulgaris. As mentioned above."}

{"question": "### Question:\nWhat does positive strep test mean?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I understand that you have done strep test, which is a rapid test to find out whether the pharyngitis has bacterial origin. The strep test is positive and this means most probably the Streptococcus pyogenes detected in your throat is the causative organism for the pharyngitis. The strep throat infection has to be treated with appropriate antibiotics. I suggest you take a course of Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid (625 mg) twice daily after food. Take supportive treatment in the form of salt water gargling of the throat, anti-inflammatory and pain killer tablets. Also avoid spicy, oily and masala-rich foods, which aggravate the throat irritation. As a painkiller, I suggest tablet Paracetamol 650 mg twice a day. Anti-inflammatory tablets are combinations of trypsin-chymotrypsin enzymes. If you do not get relieved with this antibiotic, then I suggest you go ahead with a throat swab culture and sensitivity. That will tell us about the details of the antibiotics to which the organism is susceptible and resistant. With your blood pressure values, I see that they are towards the higher side. However, if it was measured using a digital BP apparatus, it is bound to be erroneous. Kindly visit your GP and get your BP checked. Manual measurement of BP is the preferred method. At your age, it is unlikely that you have this high BP. For further information consult an ENT otolaryngologist online -->"}

However, the earliest you can detect pregnancy would be after 7 days post-intercourse with a serum beta-hCG test. If it shows the level of hCG more than 5 ng/dL then shall confirm pregnancy.

{"question": "### Question:\nKindly help me to clarify that my period is normal or is it due to the side effect of I-pill.\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Let me start by assuring you that you are not pregnant and need not worry. If you have had your periods 18 days before taking I-pill, your ovulation would have been around 13 to 15 days after that. Life of egg is only one day. So there is no chance of an egg being alive on that day of sex. I-pill or emergency contraception pill is a high dose of progesterone hormone. After ovulation, your ovary also will be producing the same hormone. As you have taken it after the ovulation date, the thickness of the inner uterine lining would have increased further. But would not have shed. Usually, if you take it before ovulation, your bleeding will start within a few days. So you should have had your regular periods, slightly thicker or more than usual. If you had bleeding almost like regular periods, then the inner lining of the uterus has been shed. There is no chance of pregnancy if at all, to catch inside the uterus. So do not worry, your next period will be one month from this period. I hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more questions and for your feedback."}

As you said most probably it is the beginning of labor pain. Usually cervix, the mouth of uterus is slightly to the left. Pain usually lasts for a few seconds only, but reappears. Do not worry. Minimal vaginal discharge with this pain indicates that cervix is gradually opening. To confirm about the pain, just feel the top of uterus, trying to indent your fingers. When no pain, you can feel the baby parts. When you get the pain, uterus contracts and becomes stony hard, you will not feel baby parts. Just having pain is not an emergency. Just note four points: 1. Movement- you should have atleast four movements after each meal. 2. Pain- if it is frequent and lasts longer. 3. Leak- you will feel thick water just wetting your clothes. Not minimal discharge. 4. Bleeding- obvious red colour. You will need medical help in all these situations.

{"question": "### Question:\nIs it mandatory to remove the premolars for my orthodontic treatment?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I can tell you about treatment in the broader sense. In case of the shorter lower jaw, either a surgical and orthodontic treatment is done (in case of poor esthetics, both jaws and teeth are corrected) or orthodontic correction of only teeth. Since your question is about the second treatment plan and pertains to extractions I will answer that. Extractions are relatively common in orthodontic treatment to create space. In cases with smaller lower jaws with space requirement, upper arch extractions are mandatory. Lower arch extractions are also advised if there is space requirement or extractions needed for bite improvement or maintenance of normal bite. So it is reasonable to advise the extraction of four teeth. You can send pictures of your teeth and X-rays to confirm whether this fits your case."}

{"question": "### Question:\nI had vibration in my chest associated with shoulder pain. What does it indicate?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello.

But at least, you should get a baseline ECG. So, I suggest seeing your general physician within the next few days. Other things that are pertinent when you have fast heart rhythms are: 1. Excess production of thyroid hormone (a thyroid test TSH would be appropriate).2. Excessive consumption of caffeine.3. Any recreational drug use like cocaine.4. Electrolyte imbalance.If you get these episodes frequently, you should see a cardiologist who can order some tests."}

Second of all, it is more advisable to get digital images of this lesion captured by an optometrist or an ophthalmologist through a slit lamp and under magnification for better evaluation. Thirdly, if an ophthalmologist has confirmed your suspicion, a biopsy can be taken from it and sent to histopathology in the assessment at a cellular level, which will clear all doubts completely."}

Use sunscreen over face and hand every four hourly till evening. This will prevent further development of disease. Now to treat existing lentigines we can opt for laser.

{"question": "### Question:\nEars feel clogged while in a closed room. Why?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Rather than a closed or open room, this is related to outside and inside ear pressure. There is an air cavity in our ear called a middle ear, and there is a membrane which separates this cavity from the external environment called a tympanic layer. So, there is air on either side of the tympanic membrane. So, when pressure on either side if high, then the membrane gets fixed and cannot move properly, giving the feeling of a clogged ear. And there is a connection between the middle ear cavity and our throat which equalizes pressure within the ear cavity and outside environment. So, whenever one gets an infection, then this tube blocked and there occurs a mismatch of pressure leading to clogged ear. And also swallowing movements opens this tube temporarily, which helps in equalizing the pressure leading to relief. Similar things occur when one travels in an airplane. So pressure changes are decisive in this. I hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."}

There is also a subdural collection, which is causing mild compression on the left frontal lobe. I would recommend consulting with a neurosurgeon about this.

Well, most of our patients initially complain to us about very vague symptoms at onset, just like yours. But we explore the possibility based on some more information and yes, of course, investigating them thoroughly. The pain you mention which made you still and shaky, can be arising from the gut as in abdominal colic (a sudden wave of spasm in muscles within the gut). Or can be arising from endometriosis which is anther problem of the female genital tract, whereby there is excessive growth of normal uterus tissues in the lower part of the belly. Thirdly, it can simply be due to perimenstrual syndrome which is pain occurring at the time of menses. For now, I suggest you to do some test and ultrasound abdomen and pelvis, later we can discuss the findings of your result. Functional abdominal colic. Perimenstrual syndrome. Endometriosis.

{"question": "### Question:\nNeed second opinion on Celexa and Buspar for severe anxiety/panic attacks\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. You are not on too high a dose of celexa or buspar. However serotonin syndrome is not always dose dependant. I feel just the chills and sedation are too general to be indicative of serotonin syndrome. You should have some level of muscle rigidity, high fever, muscular contractions (myoclonus) to suggest that. In my professional opinion I do not have much faith in Buspar. Celexa is good enough as an antidepressant (SSRI) to eventually help you have a full remission of depression, anxiety and panic attacks. If I was your treating psychiatrist, I would have supplemented the celexa with clonazepam (Klonopin) on a as needed basis, between 0.5 and 1mg every 8 hours PRN anxiety. If you are feeling cold and shivering constantly you might need to see your PCP (Primary Care Physician) to urgently address if you have an active urinary tract infection and also have him check your thyroid function. In effect, I advise you to stop the Buspar for now. Hope it helps. Get back to a psychiatrist online for further help -->"}
{"question": "### Question:\nI do not feel any sensation in my penis at the time of sex. Does masturbation cause this numbness?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. Having less or no sensation in penis while having sex is generally due to local factors. The systemic illnesses rarely affect in this way. Masturbation is normal and it does not have any adverse effects either on sensation or erection. So it is time to realize that the sensation problem is not due to chronic masturbation. The possible reason as per available history is dryness of penis which makes the nerve endings non-functional over a course of time. To counter this problem it is essential to use oil based soap (rather than traditional soap) and skin moisturizer which prevent the dryness of skin of glans penis. It can be said that you can use any branded moisturizer for application to penis and local area after taking bath every day. During love making session I advise you to use Durex real feel which is available across the globe for increasing sensation and making the sex more pleasurable.

{"question": "### Question:\nI have tiny hard black spot on penis with no harm and it does not go away. What could it be?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from a tiny hard spot on the head of the penis. This type of tiny spot can result from various reasons such as mole produced from over secretion of melanin by skin cells. They are harmless and nothing to be worried. Penile papule appears around the penis head which does not itch or produce any fluid. They may disappear as time passes. Angiokeratoma is a tiny red bump that appears when blood vessels near your penile skin become dilated. They are rough in nature and may become thicker over time. Lymphocele has resulted from blockage in the lymph channel near your penile head. It does not need any treatment and dissolves over time. Peyronie's disease is resulted from scar tissue which is found on the top of the penis that tends to harden due to calcium deposition. Treatment is needed when it makes erection of the penis difficult. Again your penile tiny hard spot may be resulted from a pimple, cyst, or STD (sexually transmitted disease). As your penile spot does not create any difficulty in your regular performance so it is nothing to be worried and needs no treatment. I think it will disappear over time. You can undergo FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) or biopsy from a tiny hard spot on the top of your penile head."}

You have a given a complete account of the clinical situation and it is as good as doing a real time face to face consultation. It is not uncommon for women to have spotting early in pregnancy. Most often it is what we call implantation bleeding that is a process of baby getting attached to your uterus. The fact that there is no blood clot in the uterus and the fetal heart beat is present is reassuring. The diagnosis is called threatened miscarriage. In this situation there is a good probability for the pregnancy to go on well that is more than 90%, hence it is unlikely to be serious. You can continue with your normal activities as long as it is not physically demanding. It is also advisable to avoid sexual intercourse for a few weeks. Absolute bed rest is not needed and in fact may be harmful can lead to blood clots in legs. No need to follow diet restriction. Taking Duphaston (Dihydrogesterone) is alright, but again not absolutely necessary. Just be your normal self. Repeat scan in two weeks to ensure things are fine. You will continue to have some form of discharge pink or red or brown or black for a couple of weeks. But, if the bleeding is heavy with clots or with cramping or foul smelling discharge you need to visit the hospital as soon as possible.

Please check if there is any pus discharge, pain in the tooth and any other area of the mouth also has this kind of spots. Aphthous ulcer often causes minimal symptoms or problems. Oral ulcers are small round or ovoid ulcers of 2 - 4 mm in diameter. They are round or ovoid in most situations but are often more linear in common site.

Well, the whole blood and serum (white fluid within blood) contains large amount of virus, and virus can live on blood spots outside the human body for the duration of one week. So actually it depends upon how much blood, and how much time it has been on the stain that can determine the chances of acquiring infection if contaminated with food. So I guess my answer can be partially answering your query. If you tell me the exact event I may be in a better position to tell you the figures. Otherwise, as a general rule, hepatitis B does not spread via food, having said that, it can still spread if blood contaminated food has been ingested. Since virus invades the human body when comes in close to mucosa (lining of our mouth) and then spread to blood within human. This happens in the same way as one infected person can transmit infection via kissing, hugging, sharing of a towel, spoon, plates, and so on. If you are puzzled with all that information, I want you to simply get a blood test for hepatitis B infection. It is a simple blood test that can give us a clue. I hope this helps.

If you are known to snore, have apneic spells (spells during sleep where your breathing stops for several seconds intermittently), feel fatigued and sleepy during the daytime, have frequent headaches and irritability, ask your doctor to screen you for obstructive sleep apnea. If present, that may explain your chronic body pains. Even if you do not have symptoms of OSA, losing weight can improve your overall health and prevent development of metabolic diseases like diabetes.

{"question": "### Question:\nIs it safe to do extraction without wearing gloves?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Getting a tooth removed is a terrifying experience for all. It is the dentist's responsibility to address the patient's concerns and make them feel comfortable. Ideally, the procedure should be explained to the patient beforehand. Infection control is very important for the safety of both the dentist and the patient. A dentist must wear gloves and face mask before any treatment. As far as using a hammer and a chisel, these are the instruments usually present in dental clinic. They are a part of the dental instruments used for teeth extractions, especially in difficult cases. Although, a local anesthetic injection is given prior to removing a tooth, anxious patients may need more than one injection. Also, while the local anesthetic is good for numbing the area, patients can still feel the pressure sensation during tooth removal. In the end, it all comes down to proper communication with your patient and constant reassurance during the procedure."}

{"question": "### Question:\nIs it normal to have palpitations with high blood pressure?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. You have done many tests with cardiac point of view? First of all, raised blood pressure in very young age, 12 years in your case, should be investigated. It must be secondary to some other disease. One of which is called pheochromocytoma. This condition causes both high BP and high pulse rate, along with sweating, fever. These symptoms are sudden and episodic. Pheochromocytoma is basically a tumor of adrenal glands. Other cause of high pulse rate may be hyperthyroidism in which thyroid gland is overfunctioning. Other symptoms include warm hands, sweaty hands, heat intolerance, weight loss despite good appetite, fine tremors, diarrhea, reduced sleep, thyroid gland may also be enlarged, some changes in eyes, etc. As you said your diet is not good, so it may have caused anemia. Anemia leads to fast heart rate. Another cause may be your sedentary lifestyle. As you said you are not active, it causes fast heart rate on slight activity. These are some non-cardiac causes of fast heart rate. Cardiac causes may be atrial fibrillation, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, etc. Detection and differentiation of these requires ECG. If one of these is diagnosed, then next step is to detect the cause of it. Then treatment is done for the cause. So, possibilities of your condition are many. There is a huge list of differentials both cardiac and non-cardiac. Proper diagnosis requires focused investigations. Please provide your previous tests (ECG, holter, etc.) so that I may devise a plan for diagnosis of your condition which may require some other tests as well. Also send a record of daily BP and pulse rate of one week at least. Remember, if pheochromocytoma is the cause, then high BP and fast pulse may be present only during episodes and normal between episodes. Beta blocker is good to control heart rate. So please follow-up with your medical record and BP, pulse rate record."}

{"question": "### Question:\nPlease have a look over MRI and suggest that the fibrotic is still visible on the MRI.\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I saw the MRI (attachment removed to protect patient identity), the sclerotic tissue from which we have to confirm that the pain you are experiencing is mainly neuropathic and emerging not from the sclerotic tissues as much as from the adjacent structures that are rich with nerves and blood vessels. Due to the anatomic changes that the eye has gone through, all the adjacent structures are still adapting to those newly acquired conditions, and that is what most probably is causing the pain. Whether it is from the compression or the disturbance in blood supply, currently, there is not much to do but to keep reducing the inflammation and prevent future reoccurrence with the prednisolone, but specific preventive measures such as undergoing a comprehensive eye exam as per the ophthalmologist recommendations are necessary. That examination should include tonometry - intraocular pressure, perimetry-visual fields, and optical coherence tomography to exclude any newly acquired changes that might require intervention.

{"question": "### Question:\nIs it advisable to get RCT done in a child?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. I got your chief complaint and opinions of two dentists. As far age is concerned, your daughter still is in need of these teeth as permanent teeth take time to erupt, by 6 to 7 years they will erupt. Till then, healthy front teeth are important otherwise she will develop irregular teeth later. As tooth has changed color so it is better to act on the suggestions of pedodontist and go for pulpectomy or RCT. It will keep the tooth intact and prevent formation of any cyst later. There is nothing wrong with it and there are modern gadgets to do the procedure, she will not feel any kind of pain during the procedure. If you leave it as such, it will weaken with time and may later contribute to huge financial burden to treat irregular teeth."}
{"question": "### Question:\nMy urine and blood tests are negative after taking Nucynta. Why?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. Nucynta is an opioid analgesic, that has high first-pass metabolism when administered orally. It means only 32 % of orally administered dose reaches blood. After it produces its effect, 97 % gets metabolized in gastrointestine and liver and gets excreted out from body through urine. In your case, you have delayed (slow) intestinal movements, hence the drug may get faster metabolism and faster excretion than a normal individual. Hence, I think it is not detectable in blood or urine. Another possibility is very less amount of drug reaches your blood (less than 32 %) due to intestinal absorption issues. The half-life of this drug is four hours in healthy individual. It means, after oral administration, 32 % drug reaches the blood within 3 to 4 hours. If I draw the blood after four hours of oral administration, the amount showing in blood is expected to be 16 % (50 % of drug gets excreted by four hours). It is in a normal person. In your case, when to draw blood is the question. So, individualistic reasearch could be done for you with special care."}

{"question": "### Question:\nMy 1-year-old kid has -3. 5 and -2. 5 refractive error. Do he needs glasses?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. First of all, let me tell you that visual development takes until the age of puberty. As your child grows, his vision parameters will change because his eyeball grows with him as he ages. So visual stability will continue to change until the age of 18-20 years old. Normally the child is born with a plus refractive error unlike the case here. Your child has a condition called myopia which is a refractive error with a minus as you said. But that is completely fixable as the child grows whether by glasses, contact lenses, or LASIK surgery if it continues and he needs to take glasses off later. The most important examination in his age is something called a red reflex. You should ask your doctor if he has done it to him. Also, I would ask about the fundus examination too. If both were normal, I would not have any concerns. I want to reassure you that your child's eyes are in good health. He just needs to be examined precisely every follow up every six months as your doctor suggested, just to make sure everything is going right and to treat anything if something happens early. The glasses will not be tolerated by a child as his age is too small, as soon as he can tolerate glasses, put them on. That could happen in two years. If you need further assistance do not hesitate to contact me."}

{"question": "### Question:\nI experience on and off acid reflux as well as mild dysphagia. Does it indicate esophageal cancer?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. First, I would like to reassure you that dysphagia and reflux symptoms are very common and more common than esophageal cancer. I want to reassure you that this is very unlikely to be esophageal cancer. Esophageal cancer is more common in older patients who have a history of smoking and or alcohol abuse. In patients with reflux symptoms, those symptoms are usually longstanding, and progress to Barrett's esophagus before any cancer develops. I think that you have gastroesophageal reflux and I think your symptoms can be easily managed. 1. Start an over-the-counter reflux medication. I recommend Ranitidine 150 mg every 12 hours. It takes about 30 minutes to start working, and you can take this as soon as you get up in the morning. 2. Make sure to not eat for two to three hours before going to bed. 3. Avoid spicy or acidic foods, especially for breakfast when you complain you have the most symptoms. This would include avoiding ketchup, citric fruit juices, coffee, and tea. Try to eat a very bland diet for the next two to four weeks and see if that improves. Eggs and toast, for example, caffeine can cause acid, and so I recommend avoiding coffee and tea. If you must have it (as I can understand), try to wait until later in the morning and make sure that you have any coffee or tea with food (even just a dry piece of toast). If your symptoms have not improved in one month, you may need to see a gastroenterologist to be evaluated for esophagitis or an ulcer."}

{"question": "### Question:\nWhat is the cause for toothache after eating?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. Before I answer, I would like to point out a few issues here. You have not mentioned the location of your tooth pain, whether it is on the right or left side. The right and left indicator on the orthopantomograph (OPG) are not visible on the scanned image. So, I am going to describe the findings as I see it. To my right and left, I can see there is decay in two upper molar teeth. Upper third tooth from my right and the upper third tooth from my left.The decay in the upper right first molar appears to be deep. Depending on the symptoms, if you have acute pain that is unchanged, persistent and disturbs your sleep, then the tooth will require root canal treatment (RCT). This is because the nerve of the tooth (pulp) has been involved by the decay. If the RCT is started right away, the tooth can be saved. The decay in the upper left molar tooth is moderately deep and can be filled, if you get it done right away. If delayed, then the decay is likely to progress and involve the nerve of the tooth (pulp), then root canal treatment would be the only option to save the tooth."}

{"question": "### Question:\nWhich tests should I do to check adrenal gland functions?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. All your clinical problems appear to be related to anaerobic respiration. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows: For respiration, oxygen is most important - Anaerobic respiration mainly occurs because of reduced oxygen. You might require a lung function tests to evaluate for adequate oxygenation. If you are a smoker or exposed to pollution, dust or industrial exposure, it can get affected. Anemia requires evaluation. Hope your hemoglobin level is within normal limits. Get a hemogram done. Anaerobic respiration leads on to lactic acid production. This lactic acid accumulation causes muscle pain and tiredness. Do get your lactic acid accumulation level in blood evaluated before and after the exercise. Lactic acid level requires correlation with possible muscle storage disorders or dystrophies compared to exercise; there may be increased lactic acid production. Hydration would be washing of this lactic acid, which is possibly making you feel better. Meet a biochemist to get yourself tested for lactic acid increase and possible causes. Sweat glands can produce abnormal smell depending on diet. Look into your diet closely. Citrulline produces nitric oxide leading on to vasodilatation. It could be removing some amount of lactic acid or increasing oxygenation, but overall the main cause from lungs to blood and blood to muscle requires identification. Get the tests for hemoglobin level, lung function tests along with oxygen saturation and serum lactic acid. If all are normal, then muscle glycogen storage disorders or muscle biopsy for any pathology maybe necessary."}

{"question": "### Question:\nWhy do I get bleeding from the nose frequently?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Do you have any medical problems that we should know about? How old are you? Are you exposed to any environmental stimulants (irritating chemicals, etc.)? Most often, a bloody nose is not concerning, but it should be evaluated if it is happening regularly. How much blood is coming out? A teaspoon? Is it always one nostril? You can certainly start using a saline nasal spray three to four times a day in each nostril. You can also put some Vaseline in each nose before you go to sleep at night. However, if there are any other medical problems or anything concerning in your history, as I mentioned above, then you should be evaluated in person. You may need to see an ear, nose, and throat (E.N.T) doctor who can take a look in your nose and see if any blood vessels are prominent and can be treated with cautery.

{"question": "### Question:\nI have Braxton Hicks at 27 weeks. Could I be in preterm?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. You have not mentioned your gynecological, obstetrics, menstrual and drug history. Have you previously had a normal delivery? If no, then the body prepares itself for normal vaginal delivery in the third trimester. In the first time mother, this process is long as it is happening for the first time. So, it takes more time than mothers who already had labor and normal delivery. Everyone's threshold for pain and body's reaction to late perineal changes in the third trimester and labor are different. Only mild cramps without severe contractions episodic going towards lower pelvis from the back are Braxton Hicks and it does not show labor changes in the cervix. Pressure symptoms, bladder heaviness, and recurrent urine are usual symptoms in the third trimester as the baby is mostly in cephalic presentation and growing size creates pressure in neighboring organs naturally. But precautions are necessary. It is better to differentiate between just Braxton Hicks and labor pains with cervical changes. Preterm delivery having lots of factors like infection, fetal, and maternal anomalies and diseases, rupture membranes, etc. Pain threshold relation to cervical changes is different for everyone. I cannot rule out that back cramping, the pressure in bum and vagina cannot lead to preterm delivery but there are factors behind that also that need to sort out. Otherwise, backache, pressure symptoms, mild labor like pains are normal symptoms in most of the women in late pregnancy. I hope you get my point. If there is a pain in the third trimester, we need to check with baby monitoring and mother's cervical changes with the strength of contractions. I hope u get my point. In case of labor-like frequent contractions, rupture of membranes and reduced fetal movements, you need to report to the hospital for monitoring and examination.

These symptoms are most prominent when individuals go from the lying or sitting position to the standing position. The causes of low blood pressure could be endocrine problems, dehydration, blood loss, severe infection (septicemia), severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), or lack of nutrients in your diet. My advice to you is to eat a diet higher in salt, drink a lot of fluid especially in hot weather and while sick with a viral illness. And for your case, try to measure your blood pressure before and after taking normal saline. If there is no change, you can talk to an endocrine specialist.

{"question": "### Question:\nCan long term usage of Ismo trigger low blood pressure and vertigo?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Firstly, Ismo (Isosorbide Mononitrate) is given for angina or chest pain. If one is not having it without Ismo then it may be stopped. So it is not an absolutely necessary medicine in absence of angina. Next thing, it can cause low BP, and low bp can cause dizziness. But, you mentioned, the lowest BP recorded was 110 systolic, and it is not too low to cause dizziness usually. Have you checked your BP while you being dizzy? So this BP can cause dizziness but not usually. Next thing, you said the response to Vertin (Betahistine), which is not likely in Ismo or hypotension induced dizziness. Vertin is for vertigo induced from the internal ear which is a very common problem. Also, importantly. dizziness induced by hypotension or Ismo will occur on standing or walking, but not while lying down or resting. So if it occurs on lying down as well or on neck movements then it is likely from the internal ear. Next, you should get one echo done to rule out the decrease in heart function as BP is remaining on the lower side. So overall, just go through the above description, and try to decide whether it is Ismo induced or from the internal ear, and you may stop Ismo as advised by the local cardiologist. Also, echo is necessary."}

{"question": "### Question:\nWill foreign bodies cause redness in eyes?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. First this to rule out is a foreign body in the eye. For that ask someone to examine your eye with a torchlight and also check the upper lid by everting it because that is the common site for foreign body. Sometimes a very small foreign body cannot be seen with the naked eye and need an eye exam by a doctor. Wash your eye with clean water. If there is no foreign body seen then it is most probably conjunctivitis (that presents with the same symptoms) usually viral conjunctivitis. It usually takes 7-10 days to complete recovery but during this period protect your other eye and other family members because it spreads from one person to another through contact. For symptomatic relief, keep washing your eyes with cold water and do icepacks. That helps to relieve discomfort. Start antibiotic (Moxifloxacin 0.5%) eye drops four times a day to avoid secondary infection. If pain and discomfort are severe consult your nearby eye doctor for a complete eye exam."}

{"question": "### Question:\nWhat causes palpitations and episodes of passing out for a few years?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. The probable cause in you is a cardiac arrhythmia. Firstly, were these episodes witnessed by others? And I guess there are tonic clonic movements as seen in seizures. Also, any precipitating events like stress, urination or passing stool, etc., this is to rule out the possibility of vasovagal syncopes. So, considering the likely possibility of cardiac arrhythmia and recurrent syncopes, there is an option of electrophysiological studies which can answer the cause. Otherwise, we will have to wait and watch until the episode of arrhythmia recurs and captured on ILR (implantable loop recorder). But, if you are having symptoms at present and there is nothing on ILR, then it cannot be a cardiac arrhythmia. So, if you are symptoms at present, then ILR should be interrogated, and if asymptomatic, then electrophysiological studies is an option. Otherwise, wait and watch. I hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."}

{"question": "### Question:\nFollowed by PMS, my period lasted for only two days. Is it worrisome?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Firstly, a single episode of early menstruation with normal flow does not qualify for being labeled as a case of polymenorrhea. Secondly, as you have been protected during intercourse, an implantation lasting for two complete days is also unlikely. So, you are pregnancy safe. Thirdly, the early withdrawal is likely to be stress induced hormonal imbalance especially progesterone level during this cycle which caused PMS (premenstrual syndrome) and menstrual cramps in this cycle. So, there is no actual need to be worried. Just maintain a menstrual calendar for next three months to understand the pattern of bleed. If the pattern continues then a hormonal profile and an ultrasound pelvis shall be required. But as of now, no intervention or investigation advised. Just increase your water intake and if not then try yoga and meditation which are great stress busters."}

However, the following are the possibilities. Post menopausal hormone imbalances - You might have increased spurts of estrogen production which are causing the hot flashes. This is common in such menopausal age and requires only mild treatment if there is evidence of the increase. For this, get the following tests done - FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), LH (luteinizing hormone), estradiol and progesterone levels in blood. Hypertension - Get your BP monitored on daily basis at different times of the day and see if there is increase in levels at any point of time. This is again a reason for hot flashes, anger and weakness. It can be cured with mild medicine if found to be present. Check for your thyroid levels. Since you are overweight, there might be a possibility that you are suffering from hypothyroidism. Vitamin D3 levels - this is another reason for general weakness. Now if we go to further serious reasons, then one probability can be TIA (transient ischemic attack), there can be slight loss of blood supply to the brain which might be causing weakness in limbs. I am not sure if this would fit into you as coming to a conclusion requires medical examination which we cannot do online. I would suggest that you send us all reports as mentioned above and also go to a doctor to get full examination done. Only then we can comment on what is the right treatment in your case."}

{"question": "### Question:\nI am suffering from mood swings. Kindly advice is this due to bipolar disorder.\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Let me answer your questions via some bullets some points to make things easier to understand. 1. You are only 14 years old, and it is very unusual for a significant mood disorder like bipolar mood disorder to manifest at such a young age. However, this does not mean it is impossible but just far less likely. 2. As a young woman at 14 years of age, it can be considered completely to have mood swings and sleep disruption due to premenstrual hormonal changes. Puberty, overall, is a time of huge biological and psychological change and is not uncommon for a person to experience broad mood changes within one day. 3. I feel your mood swings and general well being should have a keen eye kept on them. If you have a severe mental health disorder, it will become clear fairly soon. 4. From your point of view, as long as you are still able to function normally at school and keep up with your academics as well as maintain relatively good social interactions you are very likely not suffering from a severe mental illness like bipolar. Also, consider the extent of your inner sense of personal distress. Sometimes things can seem like the end of the world in puberty but are much less severe when viewed from a different perspective. 5. I think it would be wise if your parents could allow you to see a psychotherapist or counselor regularly going forward for you to unload your feelings in a safe and confidential environment. Also, such a person could keep an experienced eye on you, and if any severe psychiatric symptoms appear, they can be recognized and acted on it correctly. 6. So my final suggestion is to ask your parents if they are willing to help you find a suitably qualified psychologist and counselor that you can see regularly and feel you can trust them with your feelings. Remember if you are unsure about how you feel and if it is reasonable and not something to worry about, it is always better to speak up about how you think, just as you have done here. Should see a clinical psychologist or counsellor regularly."}
{"question": "### Question:\nI am having swollen lymph node in my neck. Will it be painful after adjusting my neck?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I do not think that because of chiropractor there will be any trouble to the lymph node. If the pain is radiating in nature, then it can be related to intervertebral disc injury which can be a past injury and due to which you had a sore neck. As the intervertebral discs are located in between the two vertebral bodies and the muscles are the supporting structures any trouble to the disc can first make the muscle sore and change the normal curvature of the cervical spine. The radiating symptoms can arise due to nerve root entrapment by the muscle as well as the intervertebral disc. Having an MRI scan of the cervical spine will be useful to avoid further injuries. Also, doing hot water fermentation will help to reduce the muscle spasm of the cervical spine region and the trapezius muscle by which the normal alignment of the cervical spine is achieved. Using cervical soft collar will help to reduce the mobility of the cervical spine leading to stabilization of the joints and less nerve root entrapment. Exercises like static neck exercises, shoulder stabilization exercises, interscapular muscle strengthening exercises will help to regain the muscle strength and correct the cervical spine alignment. If you have any more questions, you can ask me anytime."}

{"question": "### Question:\nHow can I manage dysfunctional pancreas?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. I have reviewed your query and can well understand your worries. I would recommend combatting this situation without medications as these medications will also affect your stomach. Try not to take pain medications as much as possible. In severe and unbearable pain you can take though. You already had fundoplication and taking pain medications can cause gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or gastric ulcers along with hyperacidity in the stomach. Without having a look at gallbladder it is difficult to say anything about the origin of issue that may have caused pancreatic insufficiency. For diagnosing gallbladder issues (sludge accumulation inside or gallstones) we need to go for an empty stomach ultrasound study of the abdomen. It can show most of the gallbladder issues along with any correlation between the gallbladder and pancreatic issues like gallstones and pancreatic insufficiency. Alcohol is not good for the pancreas. It is the single most dangerous threat to the pancreatic normal functions. It may also lead to pancreatic cancer along with smoking, age, and infection of the pancreas. It is not severe. Yes, you should deal it like this conservatively, as aforementioned in detail. Hope it helps. Please go ahead for further pancreatic studies as advised by your physician and avoid smoking and alcohol as these are like a poison to the pancreas in this scenario."}

Have you done any testing for the same? When a patient comes to us with symptoms like yours we ask for all these details in history to rule out any neuroma in the nerve or age-related hearing loss or Meniere's disease. A basic investigation that we ask is pure tone audiogram. Additionally, I would suggest you get a SISI (short increment sensitivity index) test done. These two should give us a fair idea and help us rule out the above conditions and check for the cause of tinnitus. If the tinnitus does not have any cause we can help you tolerate it using tinnitus matching and masking. Some centers also provide tinnitus retraining therapy. These are useful.

For more information consult a general medicine physician online -->"}
{"question": "### Question:\nI have excessive daytime sleepiness. Why and how to treat it?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. You have obstructive sleep apnea. Please say about other symptoms whether you had snoring, interrupted sleep, unrefreshed sleep, and morning headaches. If you had these symptoms, it supports the diagnosis. It is a condition characterized by obstruction of upper airway especially during sleep due to narrowing of airway due to obesity. Obstruction of upper airway leads to temporary stoppage of respiration, increased sympathetic drive, and increased pulse rate. Also, another reason for pulse rate rise is deconditioning as you are not accustomed to activities. You can do ENT examination if you have nasal stiffness, and recurrent tonsillitis to rule out the nasal causes of obstruction. You can also do a thyroid function test, lipid profile, sugar, Hba1c, vitamin D, and polysomnography. Polysomnography is a sleep study used to confirm the diagnosis and to know the extent of the disease. CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is needed. You have to reduce weight. It is the first line of treatment. You need to have low fat, and a low-calorie diet to lose weight. Secondly, CPAP is a mask and device, and the pressure during inspiration and expiration during sleep keeps your airways patent and avoid this from happening. Also, regular exercise is essential. Chest physiotherapy and yoga will be helpful. So you can follow these steps, or you can visit a nearby sleep specialist or pulmonologist."}

{"question": "### Question:\nMRI shows stroke and brain changes. Is it due to untreated sleep apnea?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I carefully went through your question and the patient's medical history. I reviewed her medical report and the uploaded brain MRI study (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and would explain that those changes are indicative of small vessel disease, which means chronic gradual blockage of small vessels inside the brain. I agree with you that untreated sleep apnea, for such a long time, can lead to these brain changes. On the other hand, you should know that other risk factors such as uncontrolled high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, diabetes, age, migraine if present, smoking contacts, obesity, sedentary life, etc., also contribute to these changes, besides sleep apnea. Unfortunately, these brain changes are irreversible. This means that adequate treatment of sleep apnea and a better control of blood pressure values or blood lipid profile, will not make them vanish. But, all these measures will help stop the progression of this disorder and prevent further changes to the brain. You should know that sleep apnea is a known cardiovascular risk factor, which means that it contributes to uncontrolled hypertension and atherosclerosis process (generalized narrowing of blood vessels in the brain, heart and other organs). So, I am sure the CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) device will help stop the progression of these changes. These brain changes in later stages can lead to dementia and depression or gait disturbances. That is why, it is necessary to keep under control all the above-mentioned risk factors (including sleep apnea), in order to stop the progression of this disorder. I would also recommend checking fasting glucose and blood lipid profile every six months, to be sure that she does not suffer from dyslipidemia or diabetes. It is also advisable to take daily Aspirin of 80 to 100 mg (if there are no contraindications to this drug), in order to prevent the progression and further small strokes in the future. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. Hope you will find this answer helpful.

{"question": "### Question:\nAre my chronic granulomatous disease and sleep apnea connected to each other?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an immunodeficiency condition where the white blood cells cannot fight the pathogens effectively which cause different types of infections. As for sleep apnea, it is caused by narrowing of the air passages mostly in the nasopharynx area which cause interrupted night sleep, usually the cause is obesity in short-necked persons or hypertrophied uvula. There is no relation between both except in very rare conditions (Kimura's disease) where CGD causes hypertrophy of the larynx. Please provide me with some photos of your neck and inside your mouth to see if there is hypertrophied uvula. Sleep apnea is usually associated with hypertension and severe headaches.

{"question": "### Question:\nIs it safe to take Gabapentin for diabetic neuropathy?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. Welcome to icliniq. I am Dr Anshul Varshney for your help. It's an excellent drug. Infact it's an elder sister of Pregabalin only. Gabapentin is little more potent then Pregabalin. Only possible side effect of that drug is dizziness but since your mother has been on Pregabalin 150 mg then Gabapentin should suit her. Gabapin NT also contains Nortryptilline, which helps further in neuropathic pain. Dear, if you will check side effects / reviews of any drugs you would get for all. If in doubt, discuss with your doctor once again being empathetic. I use this drug very often and most of the Diabetologists use it. So, I would suggest you to start it and see if she gets any adverse effects, we can go for other options. Though to be very honest we don't have much options other then Pregabalin or Gabapentin in Diabetic Neuropathy. I hope it helps you. If you have any further questions please ask me."}
{"question": "### Question:\nIs it serious to have mild cerebral edema, with facial fractures and post-nasal drip after accident?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I have read your concern. You might be worried of the cerebral edema if this will cause any harm. A repeat 48 hour CT scan if with any signs of wakefulness deterioration is warranted if that ever happens. The blood clots is a sequelae of the trauma to the face. Most commonly this is part of the superficial veins near the nostrils called keisselbachs plexus. This will heal. Give it 2 to 3 days until it gets crusted by itself with the help of the antibiotics to lessen chances of infection. If the CT scan is normal other than the mild cerebral edema is seen, then no further medical and neurosurgical procedure is needed. The zygoma fracture and orbital fracture is also not worrisome if does not cause any deformity (like a protruding bone), and does not need any procedure for it if it does not obstruct your visual field or puncture the globe of the eye. I agree with antibiotics and saline spray three times a day. It would also help taking some Ibuprofen to lessen the inflammation and swelling, if taken every eight hours."}

{"question": "### Question:\nWould the surgery to correct undescended testicle cause any side effect?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. I suggest that surgical correction should be done to bring it down as low as possible. Reason being, it permits self palpation of testis for early detection of any tumor. Frequent ultrasound is not feasible or practical to think of. Self palpation can be done every day. Ultrasound cannot be done every day. Surgery is a minor one. If it is already shrunken, in my opinion the surgeon may suggest removal of it. Do not be afraid and go ahead."}

I see than you haven't mentioned the date of your last menstrual period. Ideally, if you have had a regular 28days cycles, the urine pregnancy test is usually positive by the time you skip your periods. Delayed ovulation can be common in PCOS, So, I would suggest you to recheck your home pregancy test with an early morning urine sample tomorrow, and exactly at the time interval at which the result has to be read as mentioned on the kit. Sometimes if seen very late , the evaporation line also may seem as faintly positive which is actually a false positive. Early morning urine sample is supposed to be having concentrated levels of the Beta HCG hormone which is detected on the pregnancy kit. So recheck again tomorrow with a morning sample of urine. If you donot have any pain or spotting, you can visit your Gynaecologist at ease, may be in a week, and get an ultrasound done for pregnancy viability and localisation. Meanwhile continue taking folic acid & Eltroxin Medications & recheck your thyroid levels as during the pregnancy the dose may have to be changed due to increased requirements in pregnancy. Hope this helps.

In this case your ADHD will usually have been noticeable and picked up by teachers or parents at a younger age. However, many cases can be missed and only picked up later. In this case I recommend referral to a general practitioner who can more reliably assess the situation. A referral to a psychiatrist can always be made, if necessary. This is also bearing in mind that there can be multiple reasons why you might find difficulties concentrating. Therefore, it is better to proceed slowly and start with a GP consultation before jumping into any treatment of ADHD which can involve powerful medications that can have serious side effects. A screening test for ADHD like the Conner’s test filled in by both the child’s teacher and parents. To be seen for a thorough examination by a family practitioner. If there is evidence of potential ADHD, then referral to a psychiatrist or child and a dole scent psychiatrist would be the next step. As per the findings of the GP or psychiatrist. The young patients symptoms should not be completely ignored and a proper thorough investigation should be done in order that something potentially serious is not missed."}
{"question": "### Question:\nWhat are the consequences of not treating a tumor?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Tumor basically consists of cells with unregulated capacity to multiply and spread. So, if tumor is not removed, then its size keep on increasing. Also, it spreads to different organs through blood and other tissues, and occupies other organ as well. So, normal tissues or organ throughout the body is invaded by tumor cells which cannot carry out the normal function of the organ, so organ failure ensues. So, one organ failure leads to other and eventually heart stops and person dies. So, human body is invaded by cells which causes dysfunction in the body and eventually body stop working (means death) before going ahead. But, we cannot consider it as separate or new organism because new cells are not functional and cannot form organs to make a new organism. For imaginary purpose, you can think in a way you mentioned of transforming or replacing one individual with other or person who has acquired some new characteristics due to tumor cells, etc., but does not occur in reality."}

{"question": "### Question:\nWhom should I opt for diagnosing ADHD in a 12-year-old child?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. You have asked a very pertinent question. I am not sure about the medical system in your area. Usually, young children in primary school are seen by pediatricians. Once they move to secondary school and if they have any co-morbid conditions like depression or anxiety, they are usually seen by child psychiatrists. But this arrangement is not universal, and there are huge variations. Both developmental pediatricians and child psychiatrists have the training and expertise to assess and manage ADD or ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder). So if you are comfortable with your current pediatrician, discuss your concerns with him or her about your daughter's anxiety. If appropriate, they can refer your daughter to a child psychiatrist. Perhaps your daughter's response to Ritalin LA (Methylphenidate) and tolerability needs to be reviewed, and dose has to be titrated accordingly. If there are any emotional difficulties, she will benefit from pastoral support at school or some counseling. If emotional problems are severe, getting a child psychiatrist opinion may be sensible. Also, we have to remind ourselves that the management of ADD or ADHD is not medication alone. Your daughter will benefit from individualized support to help with her school performance. Her self-esteem should not be affected by ADD. Let her enjoy doing activities which can provide positive experiences. If she likes sports or drama or any other similar field, let her have regular time for pursuing her interests."}

If you are spiritual, try visiting holy places regularly if you find it helpful. You have said that you feel happy when you are around the people and low again when lonely, this is understandable. People feel better in practical social situations.

{"question": "### Question:\nHow can the problem of tearing frenulum during intercourse in a diabetic be cured?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. First of all, I appreciate you for providing elaborate history which will help in making diagnosis and advising treatment plan. Now, coming to your health query, I can understand your concern and will try to help you. Your diabetes is quite well controlled as per your HbA1c. However, the cause of tear in frenulum occurs due to short frenulum and not always due to infection. Though chances of infection are high in diabetes, usually it causes balanoposthitis and difficulty in retraction of foreskin, which is not the case with you. Smegma is normal secretion under the foreskin and is not a cause for concern, as long as you keep cleaning it. As far as proposed surgery is concerned, though frenuloplasty is sufficient surgery for short frenulum, circumcision can get rid of both short frenulum as well as smegmatic collection under foreskin. Hence, my advise is circumcision."}

If it is for 4 hours, try adding one thing in your life which you can do for 30 minutes, like exercise or playing with friends. From tomorrow for the next seven days, do that for 30 minutes. Then next week increase the time off the screen and slowly build other habits which can use your time and keep you distracted. It will take some time, but you will come out of it if you work hard. You can always share your progress or concerns."}

Currently, he is on catheter. Chances of medical management will not be successful. He needs surgery of either TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) or HoLEP (Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate) for prostate. Size is never a criteria for surgery.

His ITP needs to be tackled and with all due precautions and keeping platelet concentrates on standby. He can undergo endoscopic surgery with due risks.

As per your complaints, it seems that you might have developed dependence on Benadryl. And it is quite possible that due to this dependence you might be having these symptoms. Benadryl is basically a Codeine-based cough syrup, which is an antitussive agent OTC (over the counter) drug used to suppress dry cough. Codeine is a psychotropic substance which belongs to opioid group which is known for its dependence producing properties. Hence, due to long-term self-medication codeine cough syrup produces physical dependence. In the absence of it, body will crave for it and will produce withdrawal symptoms in the form of body aches, restlessness, palpitations, sweating, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, agitation, perspiration, vomiting, shivering, yawning and rarely fever with visual disturbances. Hence, in your case there is a strong possibility that you might be having withdrawal symptoms. But to confirm that, you have to tell few more details, We can conclude whether it is of opioid dependence or not from the answers given by you to the above questions. If it comes out to be opioid dependence, then we have to start with substitute treatment for opioid in the form of either Buprenorphine or Naltrexone, along with symptomatic management.

{"question": "### Question:\nDoes tapering the dosage of Nexito cause relapse of anxiety?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. The dose of the particular drug depends upon many reasons. So, it is difficult to tell that this dose is effective or not for the particular person. Now coming back to your questions, first Nexito Plus (Escitalopram and Clonazepam) has only half of the dose compared to Nexito Forte (Escitalopram and Clonazepam). So, when tapering the dose, few persons may relapse. If you develop the symptoms of anxiety, you need to increase the dose again. And it is quite difficult to predict who is going to relapse. Secondly, as the Nexito Plus has a lower dose of the drug, it is quite prudent that it may not be effective in all persons. So, increasing the dose is a good option. Similarly, when one is tapering the dose, some symptoms may reoccur. Then one has to slow down the pace of tapering as to avoid the relapse. So, if you are stable on Nexito Plus, then no need to increase the dose, but if you have symptoms then you need to increase it. The dose is basically changed according to the response and side effects, one is tolerating. It is individually designed to meet the requirements of that particular person. Thanks and regards.

Try taking oral birth control pills or contraceptive pills, like tablet Duoluton-L or Dear 21 or Novelon or Ovral G or Intimacy plus 3. Have one tablet at night now onwards for 21 days, and without giving a break, start the next packet. Take it until the date you want to postpone the periods, and you will get your period 4 to 7 days after stopping the pill. It is also the best contraceptive method for a newlywed couple. You will have 100 % protection and no trouble with sex. In such a case, you will have to take it cyclically from the first day of bleeding."}
{"question": "### Question:\nMy teeth are yellow. Is scaling only a temporary process to clean the teeth?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Yellowing of teeth is mainly due to one of the following or a combination of these: You have given an excellent description of the clinical condition of your oral cavity. From your history it is very clear that, the yellowness of your teeth is due to plaque and calculus deposits. Plaque as you have mentioned is yellowish and creamy. This gets partially removed with brushing. Calculi are hard deposits either yellowish, greenish or sometimes blackish in color. They are firmly attached to the teeth and do not go off with brushing or tooth powder. Even the abrasiveness of the tooth powder cannot remove the calculi. During childhood due to improper brushing there are chances of plaque and calculus formation over the teeth. Because children at this age tend to be playful and do not concentrate on oral hygiene. \"Tooth worms\" as people say are nothing but bacteria that affect the teeth. These bacteria act on the teeth and cause demineralization of the teeth and lead to tooth decay and cavities. The lower incisors and canines are more prone to plaque and calculus deposition (v shaped deposition in accordance with the tooth morphology) due to inability of us to reach the inner sides of these teeth while brushing. At this age of yours, these deposits may be due to: Dental scaling is the procedure that removes plaque and calculi. But it does not mean that these deposits will not come back again. Continuous oral hygiene maintenance after scaling is mandatory to prevent recurrence of plaque and calculi. Hence, scaling is not a wastage of money, it is an investment to prevent one's teeth and gums from infections and thereby increase the life of the teeth. So, a permanent solution for your problem is to follow these steps to maintain oral hygiene: And finally, pearl white color of the teeth indicate that they are unhealthy. Teeth which are slightly yellow, without any deposits on them are said to be healthy. Hope this answer helps you. Consult a dentist online for further follow up -->"}

First of all try to reduce your weight. At most times, it is the obesity which has been causing problems. The bleeding while passing stools can be secondary to anal fissure, hemorrhoids, rectal ulcer due to difficult defecation.

{"question": "### Question:\nDoes increased eye pressure result in glaucoma?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Over the years, glaucoma definition has changed. Glaucoma is damage to the optic nerve with visual field defects, and intraocular pressure (IOP) is one of the risk factors. Only with high IOP, we cannot label that someone has glaucoma. Because some people have IOP more elevated than normal but still that is not damaging (called ocular hypertension), and some people have normal IOP, and that is damaging for them, so that is labeled as normal tension glaucoma. So IOP only is not determining factor to label glaucoma other important factors are there. Glaucoma evaluation needs some tests like visual fields and OCT (optical coherence tomography) and optic disc. After seeing all test, diagnosis of glaucoma is labeled. Complete eye exam and analyses are needed for diagnosing. Pain is a feature of one type of glaucoma that is angle closure, and most of the patients of glaucoma would never have pain and will be diagnosed accidentally or through routine eye exam or with decreased vision. No medication is needed until the diagnosis of glaucoma is made. Risk of glaucoma is still there even if family history is negative. Especially after 40 years of age, people having glasses (myopes or hypermetropia) are at risk. So I would advise you not to worry and let your doctor decide. If he or she thinks you need some tests, they will advise you and then determine whether you have glaucoma or not. Otherwise, relax and enjoy. You are welcome for any queries."}

Elevated total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol are seen. Since the elevation is not much, also you are young (in report it was mentioned as 32 years) there is no need to start medication at present. Eat low calorie low cholesterol diet - avoid sweets, carbonated beverages, non-vegetarian food, junk food, cheese, butter and ghee. Eat more of fruits, vegetables and drink plenty of water.

{"question": "### Question:\nIs it safe to take Duphaston post abortion?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. First of all, there is no harm in taking Duphaston in your condition. It is just a progesterone hormonal analog, the same hormone is secreted from the ovaries once the egg is released after ovulation. So there is nothing to worry about taking it. I would like to know what was the indication for checking beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) value at 37th-day post-abortion, when everything was fine, you even got your periods pretty much on time? Regarding your beta hCG value, I would like to tell you that beta hCG may be detected in maternal blood up to 4-6 weeks post first-trimester miscarriage or medical abortion. Did you had a missed miscarriage or was it an unwanted pregnancy that was terminated medically, and at how many weeks of gestation? This is important because sometimes missed miscarriage may harbor partial molar pregnancy which goes unnoticed, as biopsy or histopathological examination is not done for such cases. But yes, any persistence beyond 6 weeks of abortions should be monitored carefully as these may be a hint of development of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). As your scan is normal, and also endometrial thickness of 3 mm is also a normal finding, so there is no chance of having any retained products. It would be helpful if you could share the ultrasound reports (pre and post-abortion), and the dates of the events along with the date of doing beta hCG levels to have a better idea of your situation. I would advise you to recheck your beta hCG value again after a week. Please revert back to me with the necessary details I requested you, so that I can guide you further. Serum beta hCG value after a week."}

{"question": "### Question:\nWhy am I very protective over clothing, food and friends?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. When someone eats food and you get angry, this could be due to part of anxiety. A lot of individuals with anxiety have such kind of symptoms. This is not a thing to get worried. You are on Zoloft which is an anti-anxiety drug and this should help you with time. When someone steals your clothes and you get angry then this is not an abnormal behaviour. I do not see any abnormality in this. Most of individuals have such kind of behaviour. Getting hurt on behaviour of your friend also has nothing related to your upbringing. Sometimes when we expect from an individual to whom we are close and when he or she ignores us, then it is normal to get hurt. But, if this is prolonged and you feel depressed because of this, then this might be due to some personality issue. You are 19 and at this age, such kind of behaviour is normal. With time you will see improvement in yourself."}
{"question": "### Question:\nHow to reduce the symptoms of IBS?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. Irritable bowel syndrome has these symptoms such as decreased sleep at night, depression, musculoskeletal pain or fibromyalgia, decreased sexual performance, and inadequate attention. IBS can be diarrhea-predominant or constipation predominant or mixed. In the case of diarrhea-predominant IBS, it is better to avoid eating vegetables, flour containing products and other foods containing FODMAP (Fermented foods containing oligosaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols). It is helpful for some patients. After having repeated counseling, they need pharmacotherapy. I advise taking Chlordiazepoxide with Clidinium bromide and a probiotic combination trial. It helps for some persons. In the case of constipation-predominant IBS, I advise stool bulking agents like psyllium husk or lactulose to the patient. For the depression and musculoskeletal pain, I usually prescribe Duloxetine which works better than SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). But in cases when the musculoskeletal pain is not severe, I advise SSRI. Hyperacidity is a common problem seen in these type of patients. Treat with a short course of PPI (proton pump inhibitors) first and then downgrade to Ranitidine after the symptoms get controlled. In some patients, counseling plays an essential role in the treatment of IBS."}

{"question": "### Question:\nIs Imipramine recommended for anxiety and panic disorder?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I can understand your problem. Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant drug, and yes the drug is known to result in side effects like weight gain. But this depends upon the dose, the duration of treatment, patient factors, etc. Lexapro (Escitalopram), Wellbutrin (Bupropion), Effexor (Venlafaxine), Prozac (Fluoxetine), etc., are serotonergic drugs and it is common with these drugs to see increased anxiety for first few days of starting the drugs. In most cases, this rebound increase in anxiety goes by own. So my advice is to continue the drugs even if you see worsening of symptoms. In most cases, after a week of starting the drugs symptoms remit. Imipramine is also the right choice, and the drug causes sedation so you should take medicine in the evening after dinner and should start with low doses. When the drug is started in low doses, then you will not face any rebound increase in anxiety. Kindly get ECG done before starting the medication."}

{"question": "### Question:\nCortisone injection for tendinitis is hurting more. Why?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. From the brief history you have given, it seems like there is not much to worry about. First of all, I need to know some more detailed points. Where exactly in the wrist the shot was given? I mean is it the extensors of the thumb (de quervain) or is it for any other finger? Also, do you have thyroid issues? Sometimes when the large volume of fluid is injected into the tendon sheath and surrounding area, due to distension it can cause severe pain and patients do complain of exaggerated symptoms prior to injection. Small vessels must have been punctured (quite normal) which lead to extravasation of blood hence the bruise. It will take a few more days, but both the bruise and the bump should go away. Do apply ice packs there you will get you the necessary relief. Ganglion cysts are notorious for recurrence but highly unlikely to be associated or related to the injection. If you can send me a clinical picture that would be better. Splint is fine but you do need to mobilize your wrist for a very long time otherwise you might end up having stiff wrist (2-3 weeks should not cause any stiffness). Understanding tendinitis is important you need a very specific rehab protocol and few medications and you should feel much better in few weeks time. Did you get your vitamin D levels tested? Kindly revert with the info."}

But, hope dies last, and to cheer you up a bit, there are many ongoing clinical researches on the restoration of vision in blind eyes and mainly involve implanting a chip in the retina and connecting it to the brain and although the results are not what a patient would expect, nonetheless it helps the eye detect objects on a very primitive level.

{"question": "### Question:\nCan angioplasty and ring fixing be done in an 80-year-old with history of four heart attacks?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. Although bypass or angioplasty can be done in old age, if the health of patient is promising, but if other health issues are present then it becomes a high risk case. As your mother's kidney function is poor, it becomes very risky to have an angiogram done because even non-ionic contrast medium is detrimental for the kidneys. One possibility is that have her 1 or 2 sessions of dialysis done first, then go for angiography and angioplasty and again have one or more sessions of dialysis in close liaison with good nephrologist. If this is done safely, then next risk is of bleeding. After angioplasty, blood thinning medicines are given for long time, this may cause bleeding problem in old age. Regarding bypass, it is a major surgery and needs general anesthesia, although not impossible in old age but, it depends upon overall health and organ functions of body. Cardiac anesthetist will fully evaluate her before bypass. Third option is to keep her on medicines only without going for any intervention. In my opinion, consult a nephrologist that is there any chance of recovery of kidney function, if no then periprocedural dialysis can be considered."}

{"question": "### Question:\nDoes numbness, burning and tingling sensation on face mean trigeminal neuralgia?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. You should know that trigeminal neuralgia is a common complication of shingles or herpes infection. As blisters appeared the first time, it means that the herpes infection was present (probably HSV1 (herpes simplex virus, which is typical in this region). It is quite common to have symptoms before the blisters appear. The fact that the numbness persists, it means that the trigeminal nerve remains irritated by this past infection, causing the trigeminal neuralgia, although less typical (trigeminal neuralgia is typically associated to short periods of shooting nerve pain, alternated with persistent numbness in the same region). Anyway, I would recommend performing IgG and IgM for HSV1 virus and also a brain MRI study. For more information consult a neurologist online -->"}

I have gone through the description you mentioned and understand your concern totally. But the details are a little confusing, it would have been good if you could give details with dates when beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) was checked. I understand that scans were performed and the beta hCG test on 8th May is 178 and on 10th May it was 247. On 13th May you got the scan as you had a spotting, right? See, as your previous cycles have been irregular, it is difficult to predict when you would have ovulated exactly. So we cannot go by your dates to calculate the duration of the pregnancy. May I know when did the urine pregnancy test turn positive for the first time? It would be advisable to recheck your urine pregnancy test now again, as you had spotting, if the levels are falling then it would be suggestive of a miscarriage, and mostly this could be like a biochemical pregnancy, where pregnancy is detected only in the blood tests, but on the scan I cannot find the gestational sac development, which has ultimately got aborted. (As levels you mentioned last were pretty low). Another possibility to be ruled out, more importantly, is ectopic pregnancy or pregnancy at some unknown location. To rule out all these, doing a serum beta hCG will clear your doubts. Serum beta hCG level. Repeat ultrasound after checking the beta hCG value. Report to your gynecologist if you have any sharp pain."}

{"question": "### Question:\nIs it mandatory to get prostate biopsy for PSA 5. 7 with negative MRI?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. I can understand your concern about undergoing an invasive investigation without any symptoms. Let me explain you what does PSA suggest. Basically, PSA is secreted by the prostate as well as some other body tissues. It does not reach circulation and hence remains low in blood as long as the barrier between prostatic tissue and blood vessel is kept intact. Rising PSA is a sign that there is some tissue alteration which has resulted in breach of this barrier. Hence, do not be under the impression that rising PSA always means malignancy. But it is better to confirm the absence of malignancy by biopsy as, at a PSA level as low as 5.7, even in a unlikely event of report being malignancy, the chances of organ confined lesion is very high, which is easy to treat and chances if cure are high. Hence, it is better to undergo biopsy and get your fears allayed. As such, the biopsy is a very small procedure and safe in experienced hands. Wish you a safe biopsy and I hope the results will be benign."}

For superficial scars, you can try Tretin 0.025 (Tretionin) cream daily night. Apply it in small amounts and very lightly over the scars, daily night for two months. It will not lead to a 100 % reduction in the scars, but it would gradually make the scars less visible by tightening the skin. If you are not satisfied with the results after two months, consult a local dermatologist for dermabrasion."}

However, we need to rule out the possibility of structural heart disease before calling them benign. So, echo should be obtained to rule out possibility of structural heart disease. Also, thyroid problems can cause these, so thyroid profile should be obtained. Also, too much coffee, sleep deprivation, stress, alcohol and other addictions may cause those, so should be minimized, if any. If too frequent and symptomatic, then one can have beta-blockers medicine like Metoprolol which suppress these. Otherwise these settles with time."}
{"question": "### Question:\nI have fever and leg pain from yesterday with a history of preauricular sinus. Please help.\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I have gone through your query. As per your query, you have taken multiple antibiotics for a long time which is not good. I need to know whether you have done a culture sensitivity test for the pus draining out of the sinus or not, because if you take antibiotics according to the culture then chances of recurrent sinus infection and fever are very less. Can you send me the photos of your infected area (preauricular sinus)? Mostly pus discharging sinuses are caused by tuberculosis infection in most of the cases. In my opinion, you should go for a detailed physical and systemic examination along with some blood tests and chest x-ray. Also, if discharging sinuses is still persisting then you need to do a pus culture sensitivity test both for bacterial culture and Acid fast bacilli (AFB) culture and other advanced tests for tuberculosis. Now you can take tablet Paracetamol 650 mg whenever you develop a fever. Please do not ignore your problem as it can lead to deterioration of your health. I suggest you to consult a physician and get a detailed physical and systemic examination done and detailed evaluation along with the above tests."}

Indeed a corneal ulcer requires patience, time, and continuous monitoring until it is fully healed or scar forms. Sometimes it might take up to a year and more. It is however mandatory that you add to the list of eye drops that you are using a lubricant (artificial tears) because dryness is inevitable after any refractive surgery and once you are using eye drops that contain preservatives.

{"question": "### Question:\nHow can I read bifascicular block on an EKG?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. Look for right bundle branch block and axis deviation. If left anterior or posterior hemi-block is also present, this makes it bifascicular block. If AV block also, this makes trifascicular block. If left anterior and posterior blocks combine, it is called left bundle branch block, if left and right both bundles block, this is called complete heart block and third degree AV block. If you are a medical personnel, it is easy to understand, if layman, then it may take some time to get used to EKG."}
{"question": "### Question:\nCan young people get bifascicular block?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. I can understand your worries. It is not common in general population. It occurs mostly in those who have heart attack, angina, have high blood pressure or some valvular disease, especially aortic valve. Other cause is fibrotic degeneration of conduction channels, but it occurs usually in old age as age-related degeneration. It may progress slowly and lead to trifascicular block or complete heart block. Treatment is not advised if heart rate is normal. If in future heart rate decreases or block progresses than cardiac pacemaker may be necessary to implant. Risk of this condition is that if it is due to fibrosis, then it may spontaneously progress which may take years. Other risk is that if anytime in future you have angina or heart attack, then there are more chances of further progression of block as compared to those who do not have this block. I advise you to repeat ECG, have an echocardiography done to see valvular disease, if present, monitor blood pressure."}
{"question": "### Question:\nMy father passes stools whenever he gets an urge to pass urine and antibiotics did not help. Why?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello, Welcome you to icliniq.com. I can understand you must be very concerned about your father's health. Well I have reviewed his medical history, which he has been taking for hypertension, prostate, and recent use of antibiotics and Imodium. So typical symptom you mention that whenever he urges to pass urine, stools passes by itself which is suggestive of stool incontinence-means loss of control stools. With his age, it is possible that he has weak anal sphincter. The anal sphincter is a muscle around the anus which contracts and control the stool output. In older age, it become weak and lack sustained contraction hence get loosened. With every attempt to pass urine, which increases abdominal pressure, would also lead to evacuation of stools. This stool incontinence because of loose sphincter at times perceived as diarrhea, however, it is not actual diarrhea. For diarrhea, once has to have stool volume more than 200 ml/24 hour, and significant change in consistency of stools like watery stools, or greenish unformed stools containing food particles. If none of these signs which are suggestive of diarrhea I suggest you to stop Ofloxacin if given for perceived diarrhea. The drug he has been taking for prostate also causes external anal sphincter and hence partly contribute to his stool incontinence. I want to know if he is feeling mucus (thick jelly like material) in stools, blood in stools or rectal pain, or repeated visits to toilet when nothing comes out? This information is important to rule out any inflammatory process beside loose anal sphincter. I suggest you few investigation for stool studies, which will tell if he has active infection of bowel and if present can be treated with antibiotics then. For treatment he can take Imodium, two tablets thrice daily for two more days. Excessive use of this medication would cause constipation and can worsen patient discomfort. I want you to help him learn pelvic muscle strengthening exercises. There are many youtube videos available to learn how to do pelvic floor strengthening exercises while sitting on a common chair. Lastly biofeedback therapy which is a computerized software which help him to control his anal sphincter while passing urine or otherwise. This treatment is offered at physiotherapy department of a hospital. Avoid excessive fibers and modify liquids (1 to 1.5 liter maximum) intake in a day. This would reduce the overall bulk of stools formation in the bowel and hence decreased stool output. Stop or reduce alcohol intake if taking. This also causes diarrhea and loose sphincter controls. I hope this helps. Stool incontinence secondary to age with loose sphincter, plus drug side effect. Digital rectal examination (performed by gastroenterologist in person). Norectal manometry (not usually required if digital rectal examination is suggestive of the diagnosis). Stool detail report. Stool fecal calprotecin and stool for occult blood. Stool for ova and parasites. Stool for fat globules and reducing substance. Complete blood count. Stool incontinence secondary to older age and drug-related. Follow up to disclose other parts of history as mentioned above. Otherwise follow above regimen and see me in one week time after investigation."}

{"question": "### Question:\nWill taking Progestin frequently to delay periods cause any problem?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. How are you doing? As you have already stopped the pill, you should be getting the periods any day next week. In that case, it was a right advise. Once you get the periods start the same pills again, without any break, till the date you want to postpone the periods. This will be a good cycle controller and a contraception. But, if you feel the periods are going to be delayed to the end of this month, then better start the same pill till the date you want to postpone the periods. Do not forget any pill in between or you will have periods in between. Just for an information, migraine can be cured by clearing the cause. Noone has found the etiology of migraine. Predisposing factors are lack of good sleep, sleeping too late, using the screens with bright blue light at close distance for long (tab, mobile, laptops, TV, etc.), missing timely meals, sweating a lot, taking too much of physical or mental strain, etc. So trying to make few changes will relieve you of this migraine.

{"question": "### Question:\nIs it normal to see blood collection at internal OS?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. How are you doing? After 12 weeks pregnancy, the risk of bleeding is low. Only a bleed from the margins of placenta is to be worried about. Cause of this collection could be: 1. Erosion and thereby minimal bleed from the raw surface of erosion. There may be mild discharge with or without some altered blood. You can have vaginal antifungal or antibiotics like Cansoft CL or Candid V or Clingen Forte once at night for 5 to 7 days. 2. If you have had sex recently. Above medications can be used. 3. I hope cervical length is greater than 2.5 cm and internal OS is closed. If not, you may need a cervical cerclage stitch. To be on a safer side, you can have: A. Injection Proluton depot 500 mg IM once in two weeks for 1 to 2 months. B. Capsule Susten or Dubagest or Naturogest or Vagestone 200 mg twice daily vaginally for 1 to 2 months. These both can be used simultaneously. They both are Progestrone hormone. They relax the uterus and if the blood has any chance to irritate the uterus, these two will stop it. So can prevent preterm labor pains. It is not easy to prevent pain once it starts, so better to use it before any risk factors. I do not think there is anything to worry, avoid any strenuous work, journey and sex."}
{"question": "### Question:\nWhat is the difference between left and right bundle branch block?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. Heart needs current to beat. Current is generated in sino-atrial node. It is like electric generator. It travels via bundle branches, which are like wires. Current goes from SA node to AV node via atrial bundles. Then from AV node to a small bundle called HIS bundle. Then goes to right ventricle via right bundle branch and to left ventricle via left bundle branch. Then it further divides down. When there is interruption in right bundle, it is called rbbb and same for left bundle branch. Right bundle branch may not always be dangerous because right ventricle is a low pressure chamber, pumps blood to lungs which is also low pressure. Left ventricle has to pump blood to whole body, it has to force more. When lbbb occurs, left ventricle is contracted via current coming from right bundle branch and it takes some time to reach left side although only milliseconds of difference but that is significant. Thus, there is dys-synchrony between ventricle which may lead to ineffective output from left ventricle, because whole vascular circuit is interconnected and should work in rhythmic synchronized way. Moreover, lbbb usually occurs due to heart attack. But all this is not as simple as mentioned. It is more complicated. It needs much time to make you properly understand the whole working of heart and its connections. Hope you got a little idea about lbbb and rbbb."}

The first-trimester ultrasound scans done before 12 weeks are the most accurate ones in the assessment of gestational age with an error of only + /- 5 to 7 days in the assessment of gestational age. So they are used for obstetric dating and determination of expected date of delivery. Moreover, if you have done 6 ultrasounds and the date calculated from each of them corroborates and does not lag behind then probably your baby is growing well and it is not small as you apprehend. The date we calculate from the first day of last periods is accurate only if the periods were regular for the last 3 months and there was no history of miscarriage or ovulatory disorder like PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) or contraceptive pill intake. In case of any discrepancy the date from dating scan at 6 weeks are accurate and to be considered. It is a probability that you actually conceived in later part of the cycle which leads to this discrepancy between the date and USG."}
{"question": "### Question:\nWhy am I having uneasiness in breathing?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. As you know, asthma is the chronic inflammatory airway disease with waxing and waning episodes. If you have asthma, your airways are always inflamed. They become more swollen, and the muscles around the airways can tighten when something triggers your symptoms. This makes it difficult for the air to move in and out of the lungs, causing symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness.There is no permanent cure for asthma, and current guidelines suggest to keep it under control with the inhaler medicines. Foracort 400 mg is the best inhaler, and you should continue using it two puffs twice daily. As far as the diet is concerned, diet can increase or decrease inflammation in the airways, depending on what you eat. But the ketogenic diet per se is not responsible for worsening underlying asthma. Rather in some cases, it seems beneficial for the patients. So, the ketogenic diet is not at blame for asthma worsening. Might be there is another reason for the change in asthma pattern that is causing uneasiness or difficulty in breathing. So, it is advisable to see your treating physician and get the necessary investigations done to find out exact control of your asthma. Also as you said, the master check up uric acid value is high and needs evaluation by the doctor. Environmental changes as high pollution, colds, drop in temperature might cause asthma flare-up, and you may need to take inhaler like Levolin (Levosalbutamol) for the time being. So overall, only after proper physical evaluation, we can decide the exact cause of your discomfort. For more information consult an allergy specialist online -->"}

{"question": "### Question:\nI am supposed to be 10 weeks pregnant from my LMP, but the scan shows 6 weeks. Why?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. Firstly, is your period regular or irregular? Were you breastfeeding or taking any pills? In these cases, LMP is not considered as accurate, and scan is the main thing to determine the gestational age. Secondly, the baby position does not play a role in hindering having measurements. The baby would sit on the lining because it gets nutrition from there, and that is what is called implantation. Thirdly, what concerning is that if measurements were the same three weeks ago why the baby has not progressed in these three weeks. Possibly one of these scans is not correct either this recent one or the last one. This thing is worrying for me, and it is good that you are having a follow-up scan, and if the baby's heartbeat is there, then you have nothing to fear.

{"question": "### Question:\nCan there be no menses when anemic?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. Based on your query and reports (attachments removed to protect patient identity), my opinion is as follows:The low hemoglobin at present is not due to blood loss, it is nutritional. If you look at the iron studies, the iron levels are very low, indicating inadequate iron in body. They can be possibly secondary to reduced intake and may be a cause of malabsorption. As the other vitamin levels are normal, it is more likely reduced iron intake or absorption. The reticulocyte count would increase in case of anemia, if the nutrition too improved. It is staying within the normal range. If you start iron supplements along with vitamin C (for better absorption of iron), you will find your reticulocyte count increasing within 2 weeks. There is no hemolysis or hemorrhage, as in both conditions, if nutrition was adequate, the reticulocyte count would have also increased. At present, all studies including red blood cell volume distribution (RDW), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) are iron studies that are pointing towards iron deficiency. Good to know your thyroid profile is good. Insomnia and exhaustion can be easily explained by anemia. Also improve the hydration (take at least 5-6 liters of water per day). Avoid coffee or tea along with food, as it inhibits iron absorption. Adding citrus fruits or vitamin C rich diet during food intake improves iron absorption. At present, nothing to worry except iron deficiency. Supplements of iron with iron fortified food and iron-rich diet should help. Also, take vitamin B-complex supplements, as early changes like ovalocytes are also seen in blood. Both iron and vitamin B-complex supplements to be taken, and within two months, you will return to your normal self. Repeat the reticulocyte count after 15 days to check if it is increasing. 1. Both iron and vitamin B-complex supplements to be taken. 2. Most importantly iron-rich foods to be taken along with vitamin C supplements. 1. Iron-rich diet, iron fortified foods. 2. Balanced diet and good hydration."}

Holter monitoring is done to identify rhythm problems, to diagnose the type of arrhythmia, and its relation to daily activities, to detect heart blocks and to monitor treatment. Now depending upon sign and symptoms and rhythm identified, the treatment plan may be devised by a cardiologist. In general, for fast rhythms, medicines are given to slow down the heart rate and also reversion of rhythm to normal can be attempted via medicines or invasive intervention. For slower heart rates such as heart block and its symptoms such as loss of consciousness or dizziness, pacemaker (which is an electronic device than generates a pulse for the heart) may be implanted. Depending upon rhythm detected, further tests may be advised such as cardiac electrophysiology study. So, possibilities are many; if you provide some history of the patient, I can guide you properly. Just tell symptoms of the patient, any current illness and medicines she is taking, any previous ECG, echocardiography or other tests performed.

Take the 21 tablets and then the placebos or choose the pill-free period for withdrawal bleed. The body takes some time to get used to it. Side effects could be headache, breast tenderness, high BP, clot formation, on long-term use irregular bleeding, carcinoma of the breast and endometrial hyperplasia that can lead to endometrial cancer. Hormonal contraceptives are better not used for many years. Better to change the method to prevent long-term side effects like after taking it for a year, you can have injection Medroxyprogesterone (three monthly) for few months, etc. For more information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"}

Not just that, an autistic child generally does not play well with others. If the hearing is normal and other developmental milestones are normal, you need to wait for another 3 to 6 months. Some children are slow. Also, another thing that needs to be evaluated is a tongue tie. Kids with a tongue tie (depending on the extent) have difficulty in creating speech."}

Many factors play a role in acne, they are, 1. The hormone is the main factor. Here acne is seen mainly on the chin and neck. A most common cause is the polycystic ovarian disease that presents with acne, increased hair on the face, hair loss from the scalp, irregular menstrual cycles. If you have any one of these symptoms along with acne, I strongly recommended evaluation by a gynecologist. 2. Stress. 3. Occlusion due to thick face creams, and foundation that block the pores on the face causing ductal block then inflammation. People from 13-30 years are more prone to acne. You have cystic acne, considering the distribution around chin and jawline, Spironolactone is the best medication in your case. Since you have a problem with blood pressure, I can suggest you other treatment options. Kindly consult your doctor to discuss the suggestions and take the treatment with consent. 1. Aczone (Dapsone) 7.5 % topical gel, it is anti-inflammatory medicine but slow acting. 2. Oral Doxycycline or Minocycline for two to three months. These antibiotics are very useful for cystic acne. 3.

This is not an implantation bleed at all as even urine pregnancy test is negative. Considering that you have been having regular spotting during this month since 14th of this month with hypomenorrhoea, there are possibilities that your serum Estradiol levels are low which is a possible cause of such irregular shedding of the endometrium. It is important that you get an ultrasound pelvis done to check for endometrial thickness which if less than 8 mm then likely that you would not conceive during this cycle. Please tell me what hormonal profile was done with thyroid levels, serum prolactin, serum progesterone, serum estradiol, FSH, LH and AMH levels to establish the cause of such irregular shedding."}
{"question": "### Question:\nKindly explain the treatment for severe headache in right temple.\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that this type of headache could be related to hipnic headache. Anyway, a brain MRI or CT scan is necessary in order to exclude a possible brain lesion, as the headache is always located in the right temple. I would also recommend performing PCR and ESR for inflammation. Temporal arteritis is another possible disorder, which could lead to pain in this region. In such case steroids would be needed. A Doppler ultrasound of the temporal artery is needed too. In case the brain MRI, inflammation tests and transcranial doppler of the temporal artery is normal, I would recommend considering hipnic headache as a possible cause. In such case Flunarizine or Topiramate would help improve her situation."}

{"question": "### Question:\nA sinus infection turned into two ear infections. Should I be worried?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. How do you feel now? Are you better? Did the pressure in the temple and area around the right jaw resolve? The reason for those two is the block of the eustachian tube on that particular side. This is the tube that equates pressure on either side of the eardrum by connecting back of the nose to the ear. When it gets blocked due to sinus or nasal problems we feel a sense of block and pressure classically in the area between jaw and ear. If the two have resolved and you are feeling better, then it is good. Otherwise, we have to check if the infection is persisting. Probably, the organism would be resistant to that particular antibiotic. In that case, I would suggest you take a course of Ciprofloxacin and Tinidazole and send a swab from the nasal cavity for pus culture sensitivity. Based on the report, we can change the antibiotic again. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. Good supportive treatment is required - steroid sprays for the nose, systemic decongestants (Phenylephrine), and an antihistaminic (Allegra) to help keep the ear dry. A persistent sinus infection with ear problems requires a nasal endoscopy with documentation of ear findings also. Do revert with more details so that we can help you further.

{"question": "### Question:\nIs Zoloft safe for heart?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Zoloft (Sertraline) is an effective and safe SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) for managing anxiety disorder. Zoloft is generally considered a low risk for QTc (is an electrocardiogram representation of ventricular depolarization and repolarization) prolongation in healthy people. I can see that you had three ECGs in the last few months with QTc between 400 to 420 which is within normal limits. Zoloft in traditional doses (up to 200 mg daily) usually does not cause any significant increase in QTc. You are only on 150 mg once daily. So highly unlikely to have an adverse reaction. Can I ask why you are particularly worried about QTc prolongation and sudden cardiac death? Do you have any relevant risk factor like a previous heart problem or family history of arrhythmias and heart problems? Were these repeat ECGs done for any specific reason or only because of your anxiety? If you are otherwise healthy, Zoloft is generally safe. If you need any other medication for other reasons, remind your doctor that you are on Zoloft so that they can avoid prescribing medication that can potentially interact together. Also, street drugs are not advisable. Regarding your other query about Ativan (Lorazepam), you can continue gradually weaning till you are off completely. When reduced gradually chances of withdrawal effects are much lesser. It is good that you are stopping Ativan as it is not recommended for long term use. I note that you are currently in therapy. It will help to address your longstanding anxiety and develop better psychological coping strategies. It is common to experience worsening of your symptoms when you lose a loved one. Hopefully, you will recover gradually from the loss. You can also try deep breathing techniques and progressive muscular relaxation for managing stress and anxiety. I will also advise you to discuss your worry about QTc prolongation with your prescribing doctor. He will be able to monitor and advise you accordingly."}

{"question": "### Question:\nI am facing premature ejaculation. How do I overcome it?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. I completely empathize with you. The problem of premature ejaculation is quite common and is distressing to a young man but is seldom discussed. See most of the time the problem is secondary to the anxiety attached to your expectations in the bed. It has been wrongly projected by unscientific magazine articles and porn that a man can last for 30 minutes or more. Honestly, most of the male ejaculate before 5 minutes. When you are anxious about not lasting long in bed, you actually do not enjoy the act of intercourse and keep on thinking about prolonging the act without enjoying it. The preoccupation and anxiety about not lasting enough, in fact, cause hyperarousal and lead to premature ejaculation. Moreover, when the male start to thrust himself into the partner the moment he undresses leads to early termination of the coital act (the sexual union that takes place between male and female during insertion of the penis into the vagina). There are also lots of young men who are suffering from premature ejaculation without any associated anxiety or apprehension. Such men as well as you may benefit by taking oral medication like tablet Dapoxetine or Paroxetine before the sexual act. But in your case, I would like to suggest relaxation techniques like breathing exercises and progressive muscular relaxation. Regarding your problem pertaining to the non-retractable foreskin, my opinion is that you must consult a surgeon. It is always better to remove foreskin if it is causing inflammation or itchiness. Non-retractable foreskin is often associated with problems of genital hygiene that may subsequently lead to chronic infections. So make an appointment with a general surgeon."}
{"question": "### Question:\nWhat medicines can treat my left-sided groin pain?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Your symptoms of groin pain while sitting or during bowel movements is likely due to an inguinal hernia. The pancreatic irritation is unlikely to cause such a pain. It causes periumbilical pain and also there is no cause for it. Now, next is there a hernia or not is unsure. If it is present then you need to visit a general surgeon, confirm it and get operated as it can cause complications. In patients with hernia, they have groin swelling, sometimes only seen on standing and coughing. Just check if it is present for you or not. For your bloating problem, you should avoid fatty, oily and spicy diet. You need to have some walk after having food instead of taking rest. You need to have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Have lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits and avoid smoking and alcohol if any. Try to achieve some weight loss through diet and regular exercise. I suggest you take tablet Pantodac DSR (Domperidone and Pantoprazole) 40 mg before breakfast once a day for two weeks. Also, you should get dewormed yourself with tablet Bandy-Plus (Albendazole and Ivermectin) at bedtime once and another dose should be repeated after two weeks.

It does not matter if it was your ovulation day or not that you had unprotected act, but i-pill works in every circumstances. And second option which you could avail to totally eliminate the chance of pregnancy (as if you have not had taken pill within 72 hours) is to opt for coil (intrauterine device) in this cycle.

{"question": "### Question:\nI have tiny raised red spots on my inner arms. Should I visit a doctor for this?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hi. Is it one forearm or both? Is there any history of travel or stay in a new place like a hotel or camping? Is there any history of gardening, or playing outdoors? Considering the history and after seeing the clinical picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I can provide the most probable causes for this rash. 1. Papular pityriasis rosea, an inflammatory condition that follows any kind of illness like flu, UTI (urinary tract infection), etc. It usually presents with red scaly spots that do not itch or hurt, starts on the trunk then extends to limbs and resolves on his own in six to eight weeks. Check for similar spots on the body as well. 2. Drug rash from the antibiotics that you took for UTI. May I know which antibiotic did you take? 3. Allergic contact dermatitis either to new cloth, sweater or new hand lotion. Do you recall using any new skin products or clothes in recent past? 4. Keratosis pilaris (KP) is one of the differential diagnosis if it is in both forearms (as in picture) and arms. KP is usually associated with eczema. Do you have any history eczema? 5.

{"question": "### Question:\nI was advised to use Finasteride for four weeks before TURP. Is that safe?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. Before I begin, let me assure you that there is no evidence that Finasteride causes malignancy when used for short term such as four weeks. As such, both Finasteride and Dutasteride can be used for reducing the vascularity of the prostate. Dutasteride is a good alternative. But Finasteride has better action in reducing vascularity in the short term. In short, let me assure you, there is hardly any chance of malignancy by using either Finasteride or Dutasteride. Do not worry, be positive and wish you a very uneventful and successful recovery, post-surgery."}

{"question": "### Question:\nMy hip X-ray is 35 mAs. Am I overexposed?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. The x-ray power output depends on mAs (milliampere-seconds) and kVp (kilovoltage peak) parameters. The average hip x-ray can be done at about 20 to 30 mAs and 70 to 80 KVp. The general rule is that the percentage increase in mAs causes a similar increase in radiation dose. In your case we can take the average tube current as 25 mAs and dose given to you is 35 mAs. Therefore you might have received 30 to 40 percent over the dose if given a 25 mAs exposure. As x-ray dose for hip x-ray is less when talking about the harmful effects of radiation, so you do not have any significant increase in radiation dose risks."}

His fever will subside in another two days. Viral fevers last for five to seven days. A cough will remain for a few days. I suggest instead of giving syrup Levolin (Levosalbutamol/Levalbuterol), nebulize him with 1.2 mg of Levolin every six hours. This is a much lower dose than syrup and acts on lungs directly. Apart from this, use syrup Benadryl (Syrup Diphenhydramine, Ammonium Chloride, Sodium Citrate) 5 mL thrice daily. Make him drink warm water, give him lozenges, and one teaspoon of honey in the morning and evening. This will take care of his problems.

{"question": "### Question:\nFever with low WBC count. Could Eptoin be the cause?\n### Answer:", "answer": "Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that Eptoin (Phenytoin) is a drug used to treat or prevent seizures. It does not usually affect WBC, but very rarely (like all the drugs) it can cause suppression of the blood cell formation in the bone marrow. The low WBC count can be related to different possible causes like viral disease, an autoimmune disorder, drug adverse effects, etc. A myelogram may be needed to exclude a possible hematological disorder. In the meantime, I recommend taking Eptoin, as it is well known that high fever can lead to seizures. I would also recommend taking steroids, because they can increase WBC and also help fight the fever."}
